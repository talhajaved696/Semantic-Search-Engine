James Godfrey MacManaway PLD 1950 PC 149 ref.  (b) Interpretation of statutes---  ----Reference to dictionary meaning of a word---Propriety---Reading words into an Act unless it was absolutely necessary to do so was contrary to all rules of construction---Reference to dictionaries by the judges, without first examining the statutory provision and its context, was inappropriate---Such an approach may result in incorporating into the legislation something which it did not contain, and what the Legislature did not intend.

(d) Companies Act (XIX of 2017)---  ----S. 2(1)(50)---'Promoter'---Fiduciary duty---Scope---Promoters of a company, in the context of company law, stood in fiduciary relationship to it---Promoters had in their hands the creation and moulding of the company; they had the power of defining how, and when, and in what shape, and under what supervision, it shall start into existence and begin to act as a trading corporation---Two fiduciary duties imposed on a promoter were; first, not to make a secret profit out of the promotion of the company without the company's consent; and second to disclose to the company any interest which he had in a transaction entered into by it.

(f) Interpretation of statutes---  ----Penal provision---Such a provision was to be construed strictly---Where any penal provision was susceptible to two or more interpretations then the one which did not extend the penalty/liability was to be preferred to one that did.

(On appeal from the judgment dated 13.8.2015 passed by the High Court of Sindh at Karachi in C.P. No. D-3977 of 2014) (a) Administrative law---  ----Discretionary power, exercise of---Scope---Law recognizes no such thing as an unfettered discretion---All discretionary powers, especially that as conferred by statute, must be exercised in terms of well-established principles of administrative law, which were of longstanding authority and had been developed, enunciated and articulated in many judgments of the Supreme Court.  (b) Administrative law---  ----Discretionary power, exercise of---Scope---Discretionary statutory power could only be exercised on a ground or to achieve an object or purpose that was lawfully within the contemplation of the statute.  (c) Sales Tax Act (VII of 1990)---  ----S. 40B---Posting of Inland Revenue Officers at premises of tax payer---Question as to whether such posting was time bound---Power under S. 40B of the Sales Tax, 1990 had been granted to monitor the production, sale of taxable goods and stock positions of a registered person or class of such persons, by posting Inland Revenue officers at the relevant premises---Such monitoring was not intended to be indefinite and could only be for some object, ground or purpose that was legitimately and lawfully within the contemplation of the Sales Tax Act, 1990---Once the purpose of monitoring had been served or object achieved or the ground stood exhausted, the monitoring must come to an end; it could not be left to the unfettered discretion of the Board, the Chief Commissioner or the Commissioner (as the case may be) to determine when the purpose had been served or object achieved---Exercise of the power conferred by S. 40B was time bound in the sense that some timeframe or period must be given in any order made under the section---Relevant authority would always have the option to reassess the situation at or near the conclusion of the period, and if there were legitimate grounds for extension, then a further period may be granted---Equally, it would be open to the concerned person/taxpayer to challenge any exercise of the statutory power or any extension in the period, in accordance with law.

(Against judgment dated 27.10.2015 of Lahore High Court, Lahore, passed in Writ Petition No. 30944 of 2015) (a) Punjab Local Governments Act (XVIII of 2013)---  ----S. 27(2)(i)--- Constitution of Pakistan, Art. 63(1)(h)---Disqualifications for candidates---Conviction and sentence for a term not less than 'two years'---Multiple convictions carrying sentences of less than two years each---Candidate in question was convicted on four counts under different provisions of law and sentenced for a term of one year and six months imprisonment against each count---Sentences were ordered to run concurrently---Question was whether conviction on four counts and a sentence of one year and six months on each count was to be seen cumulatively or in the perspective of being served consecutively in the context of S. 27(2)(i) of the Punjab Local Government Act, 2013 (Act) read with Art. 63(1)(h) of the Constitution---Held, that benefit of running of the sentences concurrently was only to the extent of the period of incarceration in jail and the same would have no effect on the sentences awarded to a person on different counts which had to be read cumulatively for the purposes of disqualification envisaged by Art. 63(1)(h) of the Constitution and S. 27(2)(i) of the Act---For purposes of Art. 63(1)(h) of the Constitution and S. 27(2)(i) of the Act, the portion of sentence actually served was of no relevance and the disqualification was attracted on the basis of conviction and sentence awarded as opposed to served---Similarly when a person was convicted and sentenced for more than two years, but for a number of possible and perfectly legitimate reasons, he was released after serving a period of less than two years, the bar of Art. 63(1)(h) and S. 27(2)(i) of the Act would still be attracted, as the material consideration was conviction and sentencing and not the actual time for which the convict served his sentence. [Ch. Zahid Iqbal v. Returning Officer NA-162 (Sahiwal III) and 3 others 2013 CLC 1856 approved].  Ch. Zahid Iqbal v. Returning Officer NA-162 (Sahiwal III) and 3 others 2013 CLC 1856 approved and reaffirmed.  (b) Punjab Local Governments Act (XVIII of 2013)---  ----S. 27(2)(i)--- Constitution of Pakistan, Art. 63(1)(h)---Disqualifications for candidates---Conviction and sentence for a term not less than 'two years'---Suspension of sentence---Effect on disqualification---Suspension of the sentence awarded to the candidate would have no consequence on his conviction which was complete as soon as the person charged had been found guilty by a Court of competent jurisdiction---Conviction of the candidate was relevant in the context of Art. 63(1)(h) of the Constitution and S. 27(2)(i) of the Punjab Local Governments Act, 2013 (Act)---Suspension of sentence would have no consequence on the conviction of the candidate the purposes of being qualified to contest either the local bodies elections or the elections for the Legislative Assemblies---Unless the conviction was specifically suspended by the Appellate Court by assigning cogent reasons therefor, or the appeal of the candidate was ultimately allowed and his conviction as well as sentence were set aside by the Appellate Court, the conviction of the candidate would continue to hold the field and the disqualification incurred by him, by reason of this conviction, shall remain intact.

(On appeal against the judgment dated 14.03.2006 passed by the High Court of Sindh, Karachi in ITR No. 03 of 1994) Income Tax Ordinance (XXXI of 1979) [since repealed]---  ----Second Sched. Pt. 1, Clause 170 [since repealed]---National Funds Bonds---Interest income---Exemption from tax---Company had invested in National Funds Bonds---Interest income on such bonds was exempt under the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Company had also borrowed loans from international borrowers and foreign states---Income tax Officer drew an inference that borrowed monies/loans were diverted to purchase the National Funds Bonds to derive tax free income, therefore, he disallowed the interest accrued on the loans in proportion to the interest income derived from the Bonds---High Court found that tax authorities were not justified in confirming disallowance of proportionate interest on the basis that loans obtained by the company were utilized in the purchase of fixed assets and the investment in the National Funds Bonds was made from the capital and unappropriated profits available with the company---Validity---Tax department failed to point any restriction under the law that would have disentitled the company from claiming exemption on the interest income in case there were loans standing against it---Perusal of statement of accounts filed by the company showed that long term loans were obtained by the company prior to the purchase of the Bonds which were to be discharged with interest over a long period of time, hence, independent of the financial obligation against the long term loans, the company made investment in the National Funds Bonds with its own funds generated from its business---Interest income derived thereon was admittedly exempt under the law and had no co-relation whatsoever with the loans---Irrespective of any co-relation between the two, no provision of law provided that mere existence of financial obligation in the form of loans would have disentitled the company from claiming exemption granted under Clause 170 of Second Schedule to Part I of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Appeal filed by tax department was dismissed accordingly.

(Against the judgment dated 25-4-2006 of the Lahore High Court, Lahore passed in LPA No.169 of 1968) Displaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitation) Act (XXVIII of 1958) [as amended]---     ----S. 20 & Sched. Para. 9---Illegal transfer---Tranferee holding Provisional Transfer Order---Misrepresentation and fraud---Power of Settlement Department to re-open such a transfer and cancel the same---Legal entitlement of transferee/respondent in the present case only extended to one property, however he fraudulently got transferred two properties in his name from the Deputy Settlement Commissioner---Property purchased by the appellant in open auction included one of properties (disputed property) fraudulently and illegally transferred to the respondent---Respondent failed to establish his entitlement to the disputed property---Revenue records showed that disputed property was part of the hotel land purchased by the appellant in public auction---When the present matter was re-opened the Additional Settlement Commissioner re-examined all the facts pertaining to the title of the respondent and also of the appellant before deciding in favour of the appellant---Transfer of disputed property in favour of respondent had been rightly cancelled by the Settlement Department.   Respondent only had a Provisional Transfer Order in his favour, which contained a condition that in case the Settlement Department found that he had made any false representation, or concealment of a material fact, or fraud, it would be entitled to resume the property. Settlement Authorities had the inherent power to recall the impugned order in case of fraud or misrepresentation. Respondent had been allotted two plots, one of which (i.e. disputed plot) formed part of the hotel purchased by the appellant in a public auction. Respondent had illegally obtained two plots of land instead of one and hence the Settlement Department was entitled to cancel one of the two plots while leaving the other in his possession and ownership.   Respondent could not rely upon Municipal Tax record to prove that both plots formed part of the same property, as such record was not important for establishing question of title. Revenue records showed that disputed plot was part of the hotel bought by the appellant.   Settlement Department had exercised great care in relation to the auction of the hotel land.No allegations had been made for and in relation to the manner in which the auction was conducted. No fraud, misrepresentation or concealment by the appellant was either alleged by anyone or found by the Settlement Department to have taken place.   When the matter was re-opened the Additional Settlement Commissioner re-examined all the facts pertaining not merely to the title of the respondent but also of appellant from the very inception. Additional Settlement Commissioner also took technical assistance of the Land Acquisition and Control Officer, a Naib Tehsildar, a Revenue Patwari, and a Revenue Qaungo aided further by the Settlement Patwari before concluding the matter in favour of the appellant. On re-opening of present matter Settlement authorities examined the official plan of the premises on the basis of which the auction was held. Transfer of disputed property in favour of respondent had been rightly cancelled by the Settlement Department. Appeal was allowed accordingly.   Khalid Anwar, Senior Advocate Supreme Court and M.S.

(d) Tort---     ----Negligence--- Composite negligence and contributory negligence---Distinction---'Composite negligence' referred to the negligence on part of two or more persons---Where a person was injured as a result of negligence on the part of two or more wrongdoers, it was said that the person was injured on account of the composite negligence of those wrongdoers---In such a case, each wrongdoer was jointly or severally liable to the injured for payment of the entire damages and the injured person had the choice of proceeding against all or any of them---On the other hand, where a person suffered injury, partly due to his own negligence, then the negligence on the part of the injured which contributed to the accident was referred to as his contributory negligence.

(a) Interpretation of statutes-- ----Fiscal statute --- Charging section, interpretation of --- Scope --- Charging section in a fiscal statute, demanded its strict interpretation and application in so far as the revenue was concerned, but where it was susceptible to two possible interpretations, it should be liberally construed in favour of the tax payer/citizen; particularly, where there was substantial doubt about the true import and application of a charging section---Such doubt should be resolved in favour of the tax payer/citizen. 1993 SCMR 274 and 1993 PTD 69 ref.

(On appeal against the judgment dated 19-9-2014 passed by the Election Tribunal-II, Quetta in Election Petition No. 178 of 2013) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----S. 70(b)---Illegal practices---Political influence exercised by candidates---Doubtful voting patterns---Zero vote count for returned and runner-up candidate in several polling stations---Average voter turnout at such polling stations almost three times more than the average voter turnout at other polling stations---Number of votes declared as doubtful in the counterfoils verification report greater than the lead secured by returned-candidate over runner-up candidate---Order for a fresh election in the constituency was justified in such circumstances.     In 21 polling stations the returned-candidate obtained not a single vote, whereas the runner-up candidate bagged 98.4% of the total votes that were cast. Similarly, in 33 polling stations where runner-up candidate had not obtained a single vote, the returned-candidate bagged 99.8% of the total votes cast. Question was as to why in 54 polling stations where one contesting candidate had not even bagged a single vote, the percentage of polled votes in favour of the other was phenomenally around 99%. Furthermore in the said 54 polling stations, in all 50,922 votes were polled, and the average vote count came to 943 votes per polling station (i.e. 96% voter turnout) whereas in the rest of 111 polling stations, where the remaining 37,358 votes were polled, this average stood at only 337 votes per polling station (i.e. 40% voter turnout). Question that arose was as to why in these 54 polling stations the turnout was almost triple in comparison to turnout on the rest of 111 polling stations. Such unimaginable differences in the voting pattern on 54 polling stations as against the remaining 111 polling stations could not be a simple case of mere coincidence, given the fact that both the returned-candidate and runner-up candidate had large following in the constituency. They were politically popular figures of the constituency as 92% of the total votes that were polled went to both of them only. Preponderance of probabilities led to the conclusion that both the candidates must have exerted their respective political clout in their respective areas of influence in order to bag maximum number of votes.     Moreover counterfoil verification report prepared by National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) in respect of 39 polling stations showed that 7555 votes were doubtful, while returned candidate's winning margin was only 3325 votes.     Illegal practices were prevalent during the election, which was not conducted in a fair manner, therefore, the same was liable to be declared void as a whole in terms of section 70(b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976. Election Tribunal had rightly ordered a fresh election in the constituency.     Kh. Saeed-uz-Zafar, Advocate Supreme Court and Muhammad Dawood Kasi, Advocate Supreme Court for Appellant.

Mir Ahmad Khan v. Secretary to Government and others (1997 SCMR 1477) declared to be per incuriam]     Service rendered for more than five years as contemplated by Article 371-A of the Civil Service Regulations (CSR) would only be added, included, or taken into account for the purposes of pensionary benefits, and not make such government servant qualify for pension per se. Article 371-A of Civil Service Regulations (CSR) by itself did not provide for the entitlement for the purposes of pension, rather, it was restricted to the counting of the period of a minimum of five years which had been rendered by the temporary employee that once he was appointed on a permanent basis, such period (of five years) shall be taken into account for the object of calculating his entitlement to pension with respect to the requisite minimum period under the law.     Mir Ahmad Khan v. Secretary to Government and others 1997 SCMR 1477 declared to be per incuriam     Article 371-A cannot be used as a tool to bypass the conditions for qualifying service of pensionary benefits, and such government servant had to fulfill the minimum number of years for grant of pension. This was due to the use of the word count as opposed to qualify or eligible in Article 371-A of the Civil Service Regulations (CSR).     It was absurd, ludicrous and inconceivable that a government servant, who was in regular employment, would become entitled to pension after serving the minimum years of qualifying service as prescribed by the law, whereas while interpreting Article 371-A of the Civil Service Regulations (CSR), a government servant who had served as a temporary employee could be given preference over a regular employee, and after a minimum service of only five years would automatically become entitled to pension. Holding so would be against the object and spirit of the concept of pension.     PLD 2013 SC 829 ref.

Returning Officer and the Election Commission rejected application of election petitioner for inspection of record. However Election Tribunal allowed application of election petitioner under section 46 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 and appointed a Commission to inspect the record of the 33 challenged polling stations. Returned candidate raised the objection that once applications for inspection of record had been rejected by the Returning Officer and the Election Commission respectively, the Election Tribunal should not have appointed a Commission to inspect and examine the counted ballot papers.     Election Tribunals were bestowed power to inspect and examine the ballot papers of all sorts i.e. polled, rejected, or spoiled etc. Such powers could not be invoked by any party to the election petition on mere ipse dixit nor, could be exercised by the Election Tribunal on its own whims and fancy and or mechanically. Party seeking such recourse or inspection and examination of counted ballot papers had to demonstrate and show to the satisfaction of the Election Tribunal that there had been improper, reception, refusal, or rejection of votes which had affected the outcome of the election materially. Election Tribunal, enjoyed elaborate and extensive authority to carry out the exercise of examination of polled ballots either itself or through commission and may order inspection and or recount of the ballot papers, however, same were to be exercised with circumspection and care by application of mind on the strength of tangible and material evidence, prima facie establishing that there had been wrong inclusion or exclusion of the ballot papers in the course of ballot count that had direct and material bearing on the final outcome of the result of the election.

Election Commission 2004 SCMR 672 ref.     (c) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----Ss. 67(1) & 70(a)---Election Tribunal, powers of---Scope---In terms of S. 67(1) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 Election Tribunal had the power to order a partial re-poll in some of the polling stations rather than declaring election as a whole to be void and ordering re-poll in the entire constituency.     Election Tribunal had the power to grant all or any of the reliefs wholly or partly as set out in section 67(1) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 and to direct the Election Commission to take such ancillary and incidental steps as may be necessary to ensure honest, just and fair election in accordance with law and further to ensure that corrupt practices were guarded against.     Where the result of few challenged polling stations did not materially affect the overall result of the election then an order of invalidating the election either as a whole or in part would not be justified or warranted. However, where the ultimate result of the election was dependent on the outcome of the ballot count of even one or few polling stations, then order declaring the election of the returned candidate to be void in terms of section 67(1)(b) read with section 70(a) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 may be justified and ordering partial poll to the extent of such challenged polling station would only be necessitated, instead of declaring the election as a whole to be void.     Election Tribunal in consideration of ground realities and circumstances of each case may suitably mould the relief as may be appropriate, just, proper and fair.     (d) Administration of justice---     ----Partial relief---Where a Court or Tribunal was conferred jurisdiction and power to grant large (whole) relief under the law, it also had jurisdiction to grant smaller (partial) relief.     (e) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----Ss. 67(1) & 70---Election Tribunal, powers of---Scope---Partial re-poll---Non-performance of statutory duties by the Returning and Presiding Officers in 33 polling stations---Vote count of disputed 33 polling stations materially affecting the overall result of the election---Election Tribunal in such circumstances had the power to declare the election of returned candidate as void and order a partial re-poll only in the disputed 33 polling stations instead of declaring the election as whole to be void and ordering a re-poll in the entire constituency.     On election day election staff committed omissions and illegalities in respect of 33 polling stations of the subject constituency, and the vote count of the said polling stations had material bearing on the eventual outcome of the result of the election. In the present case, the difference between the returned candidate and runner up candidate was only 5,885 votes and between the returned candidate and the election petitioner only 7,421 votes. Total number of votes casted in favour of all the contesting candidates in disputed 33 polling stations as per consolidated statement in Form XVI was 34,229 votes, whereas only 19,500 polled votes were recovered from the bags of said 33 polling stations. There was staggering difference of 14,929 votes which was more than double the difference between the contestant parties. Thus it could be seen that the total votes cast in the disputed 33 polling stations would in fact determine the fate of contesting candidates in accordance with the will of the people. It was established on record that only the result of 33 polling stations was stained and soiled by non-performance of statutory duties by the Returning and Presiding Officers.     Election Tribunal was justified to declare the election of the returned candidate as void, for the simple reason, that if the vote count of disputed 33 polling stations was excluded, overall result would not be reflective of the true will of electors of the constituency.     (f) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----Ss. 67(1) & 69---Election of returned candidate declared void---Not necessary that in such circumstances the election petitioner or another contesting candidate should automatically be declared as the returned candidate---Election Tribunal could declare the election petitioner or another contesting candidate as the winner instead of the returned candidate, only if it was prayed for and if the Tribunal was satisfied that the election petitioner or other contesting candidate was entitled to be declared elected.     Whenever the election of a returned candidate was declared wholly void, the election petitioner would not as a matter of right be declared elected. No doubt section 67(1)(c) read with section 69 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976, did empower the Election Tribunal to declare the election petitioner or any of the contesting candidate to be declared as elected in event, the election of the returned candidate was annulled, and the election petitioner and or any of the respondents had so prayed; and secondly in cases where the Election Tribunal was satisfied that the election petitioner or such other contesting candidate was `entitled' to be declared elected. Thus it was clear that swapping of election petitioner and or any other contesting candidate was neither automatic nor a natural corollary to the invalidation of election of returned candidate, but was subject to two qualifying conditionalities as noted.     Questions as what constituted Election Tribunal being satisfied and when the election petitioner or other contesting candidate became entitled to be declared elected were neither elucidated nor any parameters were provided either under the Representation of the People Act, 1976 or Rules framed thereunder. However, satisfaction of the Election Tribunal to exercise power under section 67(1)(c) read with section 69 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976, was to be based on rational criteria, guided by good conscience. One of the rational considerations may be where on the basis of recount of total votes and or on re-examination of valid and invalid vote count, the election petitioner and or any other contesting candidate had secured highest number of total valid votes as against the returned candidate; or in a situation, where votes of certain polling stations for any reason had not been correctly added up in the total vote count. In such like situation the outcome, was clear leaving no doubt and ambiguity in determining as to who had emerged successful. Election Tribunal could declare the election petitioner or any other contesting candidate, having secured highest number of vote as duly elected.     (g) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----Ss. 67(1) & 69---Election of returned candidate declared void---Not necessary that in such circumstances the election petitioner or another contesting candidate should automatically be declared as the returned candidate---Election petitioner had to establish that he was entitled to be declared elected instead of the returned candidate---In the present case, difference of vote count between the returned candidate, the runner up candidate and the election petitioner was much less than the number of votes found to be missing from vote bags of disputed polling stations, thus it could not be determined as to which of the contesting candidate commanded the confidence of the majority of the electorate---Election petitioner could not be declared as 'elected' in such circumstances without a re-poll in the disputed polling stations.     Returned candidate, in the present case, was shown to have secured 7,421 votes more than the election petitioner, and his lead was even narrow i.e. merely 5,885 votes as against the runner-up candidate. Election of the returned candidate was not declared to be void as a whole in terms of section 67(1)(d) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 rather on account of discrepancy or missing valid votes count of actual votes casted in 33 challenged polling station, the Election Tribunal was persuaded to declare the election of the returned candidate as void within the contemplation of section 67(1)(b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976. Total number of votes casted in all 33 challenged polling station, as per consolidated statement of votes count in Form XVI came to 34,229 votes, whereas, only 19,500 polled votes were recovered from the bags of all such polling stations. There was no explanation as to where the 14,929 votes disappeared. Since difference of votes count between the returned candidate, the runner up candidate and the election petitioner was much less than the missing number of votes, none of the parties to dispute could claim nor it could be determined as to which of the contesting candidate commanded the confidence of the majority of the electorate in the subject constituency. Election petitioner, was not able to make out any case whereby he could become entitled to be declared elected within the contemplation of section 69 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976.

(Against order dated 4.4.2012 passed by Lahore High Court, Lahore in W.P. No.3974 of 2005).

(a) Constitution of Pakistan---  ----Art. 270AA, Cls. 8 & 9---Transfer of certain hospitals and a national museum from the Federation to the Provinces in light of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution---Constitutionality---Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi (JPMC); National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi (NICVD); National Institute of Child Health, Karachi (NICH); National Museum of Pakistan, Karachi (NMP); and Sheikh Zayed Postgraduate Medical Institute, Lahore (SZPMI)---[Per Ijaz ul Ahsan, J (Majority view): Transfer of said Institutions from the Federal to the Provincial Government was unconstitutional, in that the Institutions did not fall within the Concurrent Legislative List as required by Cl. (8) read with Cl. (9) of Art. 270AA of the Constitution---Implementation Commission, which was constituted to implement and give effect to the provisions of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, went beyond its constitutional mandate in such regard---Consequently, any purported transfer/devolution of the said Institutions (to the Provinces) by the Federal Government and the subsequent notifications and orders issued pursuant thereto were unlawful and of no legal effect---Order accordingly.  (b) Constitution of Pakistan---  ----Fourth Sched.---Legislative Lists, interpretation of---Said Lists must be liberally construed and given the widest possible meaning and amplitude---Principles of interpretation with respect to Legislative Lists stated.  Following are the principles of interpretation with respect to Legislative Lists in the Constitution:  (i) The entries in the Legislative Lists of the Constitution were not powers of legislation but only fields of legislative heads;  (ii) In construing the words in an Entry conferring legislative power on a legislative authority, the most liberal construction should be put upon the words;  (iii) While interpreting an Entry in a Legislative List it should be given widest possible meaning and should not be read in a narrow or restricted sense;  (iv) Each general word in an Entry should be considered to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which could fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it;  (v) If there appeared to be apparent overlapping in respect of the subject-matter of a legislation, an effort had to be made to reconcile the Entries to give proper and pertinent meaning to them;  (vi) A general power ought not to be so construed so as to make a particular power conferred by the same legislation and operating in the same field a nullity;  (vii) Legislation under attack must be scrutinized in its entirety to determine its true character in pith and substance; and  (viii) After considering the legislation as a whole in pith and substance, it had to be seen as to with respect to which topic or category of legislation in the various fields, it dealt substantially and directly and not whether it would in actual operation affect an item in the forbidden field in an indirect way.  Messrs Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd. and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others 2018 SCMR 802 ref.  (c) Constitution of Pakistan---  ----Arts. 9, 142(c), 247 & Fourth Sched., Pt. I, Entries Nos. 15, 16---National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (Administration) Ordinance (I of 1979), S. 6---Transfer of certain hospitals and a national museum from the Federation to the Provinces in light of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution---Constitutionality---Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi (JPMC); National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi (NICVD); National Institute of Child Health, Karachi (NICH); National Museum of Pakistan, Karachi (NMP); and, Sheikh Zayed Postgraduate Medical Institute, Lahore (SZPMI)---[Per Ijaz ul Ahsan, J (Majority view): Entry No.16 of Part I to Fourth Schedule of the Constitution ('Entry No. 16' of the Federal Legislative List) had two basic requirements; first, the agency or institute in question must be federal; and second, such federal agency or institute must be for the purposes of research, professional training, technical training, or the promotion of special studies---Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi (JPMC) was a federal agency/institute and therefore satisfied the first limb of Entry No.16 of the Federal Legislative List---As regards the second limb, the hospital and institute aspects of 'JPMC' were interdependent and mutually supporting---Bearing in mind that legislative lists ought to be construed liberally and be given the widest amplitude possible, 'JPMC' did fall within Entry No.16---National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi (NICVD) was also a federal agency/institute---Research/training aspect of 'NICVD' was not ancillary or incidental to the functioning of the hospital and therefore, it too fell within Entry No.16---Admittedly, the National Institute of Child Health, Karachi (NICH) was separated from JPMC in the year 1990 and made an attached department of the Federal Ministry of Health, thereby satisfying the first limb of Entry No.16 being a federal agency/ institute---While NICH had hospital facilities, it was an established fact that it was also a teaching/training institute offering various degrees/diplomas including 'FCPS', 'MCPS', nursing programs and paramedical courses---Furthermore, 'NICH' also had facilities for clinical research, resulting in the production of numerous research papers in the relevant field---Like 'JPMC' and 'NICVD', such aspects as a whole brought 'NICH' within the purview of the second limb of Entry No.16---Prior to its purported transfer/devolution, National Museum of Pakistan, Karachi (NMP), was a museum controlled/ financed by the Federation and therefore squarely fell within the ambit of Entry No.15 of Part I to Fourth Schedule of the Constitution---In any case, there was no relevant entry in the Concurrent Legislative List within which 'NMP' would fall---Features of the 'Resolution' dated 29.05.1986 through which the Sheikh Zayed Postgraduate Medical Institute, Lahore (SZPMI) was established made it clear beyond any doubt that it was a federal agency/institute in terms of Entry No.16 of the Federal Legislative List---Objectives/functions of the 'SZPMI' as identified in the Resolution showed that it had a predominant research/training aspect which was far from ancillary or incidental to the functioning of Sheikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore and therefore, without any doubt 'SZPMI' fell within Entry No.16---Besides, at the time of the purported transfer to the Province, the administrative control of 'SZPMI' along with its staff and equipment vested with the (Federal) Ministry of Health and was given to the Cabinet Division, therefore falling strictly within the domain of the Federal Government (i.e. Cabinet Division), it could not have been transferred to the Provincial Government through the impugned notification which mentioned that the Prime Minister has been pleased to order transfer of administrative control of  'SZPMI' to the Provincial Government---Prime Minister alone did not have the power or authority to make such transfer without the approval of the Federal Cabinet---Even otherwise there was nothing on record to indicate that the said transfer was approved by the Federal Cabinet---Transfer of 'SZPMI' to the Province was clearly in excess of the powers available to the Prime Minister under the Constitution, the law and the Rules of Business, 1973---Entry No.37 of the Federal Legislative List allowed the Federal Government to exercise its executive authority with respect to works, lands and buildings vested in it or in its possession (apart from military, naval or air force works) but with a caveat, that if such works, lands and buildings were situated in a Province, then they shall be subject to Provincial legislation unless Federal law provided for otherwise---Intention behind the 18th Amendment to the Constitution could not have been to prevent the Federal Government from opening healthcare facilities in any of the Provinces, for concluding so would be tantamount to attributing absurdity to a constitutional provision---Declaration to the effect that the Institutions in question had been transferred by the Federal Government to the Provinces without following due process of law, application of mind and in a mechanical manner did not by any stretch of the imagination impugn upon or encroach the Provincial autonomy granted by the Constitution---Furthermore power of the Federation to set up, run and operate projects including hospitals and related research facilities where enforcement of Fundamental Rights was involved was an obligation of the Federal Government under the Constitution---In the present case, enforcement of right to life was involved which was one of the most fundamental of the Fundamental Rights---To curtail or circumscribe the power of the Federal Government to enforce Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the Constitution would be an athema for the concept of Federalism--- Supreme Court declared the transfer/devolution of JPMC, NICVD, NICH, NMP and SZPMI (to the Provinces) to be unconstitutional, without lawful authority and of no legal effect]---[Per Maqbool Baqar, J (Minority view): Hospitals, along with public health, fell exclusively within the provincial domain---Research and training were the most essential components of the public health, without which, the obligation to provide quality and affordable healthcare could not be discharged, dispensed and fulfilled, it would therefore not be fair to say that health related research education and training could not lawfully form part of a hospital and/or public health, in the context of the distribution of legislative, hence executive powers in a federal dispensation---Classifying a general hospital as of the category falling under Entry No.16 of the Federal Legislative List, for its conducting research and/or imparting professional or technical training in the fields of health sciences would dissuade hospitals owned and operated by the provincial governments from pursuing such activities, for a fear of being so branded, and thus being taken over by the Federal Government---Scope and extent of the right to life, as protected under Art. 9 of the Constitution was so wide spread that it embraced almost every aspect and facet of human existence---Allowing the federation to assume power and authority under such a rubric would, thus, hardly leave anything for the provincial government to undertake, discharge, or fulfil, jeopardizing the nation's collective odyssey towards greater provincial autonomy---In the present case, primary character and nature of 'JPMC' was that of a tertiary care public hospital---Research, education and training activities were made possible at 'JPMC' because of it being a hospital, and that too, with at least twenty eight different departments for treatment of as many diseases and ailments and their different strands---Not all the departments and facilities at 'JPMC' were being used for imparting education and training---Perusal of S. 6 of National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (Administration) Ordinance, 1979, showed that the core function/purpose of 'NICVD' was that of a cardio vascular hospital, while training and research were employed merely as tools and means to achieve and realize such purpose---Said Ordinance of 1979, was no impediment in the transfer of 'NICVD'; firstly for the reason that the Ordinance did not exist in the eyes of law, having been promulgated by the federal government beyond its constitutional mandate and in violation of the restriction placed on it by means of Art. 142(c) of the Constitution, as hospitals and public health never fell within the legislative sphere of the federation and had always, exclusively remained provincial subjects---More significantly, the impugned transfer of the institute to the Province, though made belatedly, was in compliance with the constitutional mandate, as prescribed by Art. 274 of the Constitution---National Institute of Child Health, Karachi (NICH) had developed into a five hundred bed children hospital, where teaching and training was carried out merely as an ancillary activity]---Order accordingly. (d) National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (Administration) Ordinance (I of 1979)---  ----S. 6---National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (Sindh Administration) Act, 2014 (IV of 2015), Preamble ---Constitution of Pakistan, Fourth Sched., Pt. I, Entry No. 16 --- National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (Sindh Administration) Act, 2014, vires of---Provincial Assembly had passed the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases Act, 2014 (the 2014 Act), which was basically replica of the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (Administration) Ordinance, 1979---Said Ordinance appeared to have been enacted to displace 'the 2014 Act'---Said Act of 2014, which was an attempt to overturn a Federal law and nullify the same, was unconstitutional, particularly considering the fact that the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi (NICVD) fell within the domain of the Federal Government---Supreme Court suspended the 2014 Act and directed that such suspension shall be subject to other directions of the Court, which shall apply in all respects to 'NICVD', and nothing in the Provincial Law (i.e. the 2014 Act) nor in the suspension thereof shall in any manner hinder, restrict, impede or otherwise affect the return and restoration of 'NICVD' to the Federation---Order accordingly.  (e) Constitution of Pakistan---  ----Art. 9---Right to life---Scope---Right to healthcare---Right to life undoubtedly entailed the right to healthcare which meant that everyone had the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and this comprised of access to all kinds of medical services including but not limited to hospitals, clinics, medicines and services of medical practitioners which must not only be readily available and easily accessible to everyone without discrimination, but also of high standard---Federal Government had an obligation to carry out all necessary steps to ensure realization of this goal.

II, Chapt. 1 & Fourth Sched.---Fundamental Rights, enforcement of---Federal Government, duty of---Scope---Federal Government was not absolved from conferring the fundamental rights contained in the Constitution upon its citizens and the State was required to enforce such rights---Such duty prevailed, notwithstanding the respective domain of Federal and Provincial executive authority as determined by the respective Federal and Provincial legislative competence in light of the provisions of Arts. 97, 137 & 142 of the Constitution read in conjunction with the Federal Legislative List---Such duty transcended and surpassed other provisions of the Constitution and could not, in any circumstance whatsoever be curtailed or abridged.

(h) Constitution of Pakistan---  ----Arts. 9 & Fourth Sched., Pt. I, Entries Nos. 15, 16---National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (Administration) Ordinance (I of 1979), S. 6---Transfer of certain hospitals and a national museum from the Federation to the Provinces in light of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution---Constitutionality---Supreme Court declared the transfer/devolution of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi (JPMC); National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi (NICVD); National Institute of Child Health, Karachi (NICH); National Museum of Pakistan, Karachi (NMP); and, Sheikh Zayed Postgraduate Medical Institute, Lahore (SZPMI) (to the Provinces) to be unconstitutional, without lawful authority and of no legal effect and gave certain directions to that effect.  Supreme Court after declaring the transfer/devolution of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center, Karachi (JPMC), National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi (NICVD), National Institute of Child Health, Karachi (NICH), National Museum of Pakistan, Karachi (NMP), and Sheikh Zayed Postgraduate Medical Institute, Lahore (SZPMI) from the Federation to the Provinces as unconstitutional, without lawful authority and of no legal effect gave the following directions:  (i) All acts done or orders, directions, notifications and directives issued or made pursuant to the purported transfer/devolution or to give effect to the same in any manner whatsoever, which were inconsistent with or in derogation of the tenor of the present order to the extent of inconsistency were without lawful authority and of no legal effect;  (ii) Till such time as the exercise (of transfer from Provinces to the Federal Government) was not completed, all matters pertaining to the Institutions shall continue on the same basis as on the date of present judgment including, but not limited to, financial and budgetary matters, disbursements, outlays and expenditures, including disbursements relating to the payment of salaries, pensions and such-like matters;  (iii) Within 90 days of present judgment, the Federal and Provincial Governments and all concerned and related authorities, entities, bodies, departments, establishments and officers shall complete all matters relating to the return of JPMC, NICVD, NICH and the NMP from the Province to the Federation such that the position of these Institutions was restored, to the maximum extent possible, to the status quo ante, being in relation to JPMC, NICVD and NICH the position as on 29-06-2011, and in relation to the NMP the position as on 05-4-2011, and such restoration and return shall include the actual resumption by the Federation of all financial obligations in relation to the Institutions and all serving or retired officers, employees or servants thereof;  (iv) If such exercise could not be completed within 90 days, the Federal Government or the Provincial Government may apply to the Court for an extension and such extension may be granted for such period or periods as the Court deemed appropriate but such period(s) shall not in the aggregate exceed 90 days;  (v) Once the exercise was complete, the Federal and Provincial Governments shall file an appropriate joint statement (duly supported by the necessary and relevant record) before the Court, which may give such notice of the same to such persons or parties as it deemed appropriate, and may thereafter and thereupon make a declaration that the exercise had been completed;  (vi) If in completing such exercise, it was not possible to restore the status quo ante in respect of any Institution in any material respect, then any concerned party may make an appropriate application to the Court, which may issue such directions and make such orders as were deemed expedient and appropriate thereon, but in such manner and to such extent as was consistent with the expeditious restoration of the Institution from the Province to the Federation;  (vii) The Province shall be entitled to a suitable reimbursement/ adjustment from/with the Federation of all disbursements and financial outlays made and expenditures incurred from the date of the transfer/devolution of the Institutions to the Province from the Federation till the date of the return and restoration thereof from the Province to the Federation and/or the actual resumption of financial obligations in relation thereto by the Federation, being disbursements and financial outlays made and expenditures incurred by the Province that it would not have made or incurred but for the devolution/transfer.  (viii) In case the Province and the Federation are unable to resolve any matter that shall be deemed to be a dispute between them and the aggrieved party shall be entitled to its remedies in accordance with the Constitution and the law.

(j) Constitution of Pakistan---  ----Arts. 97, 137, 142 & Fourth Sched.--- Legislative Lists, interpretation of---Federalism, concept of---Scope---Spirit and soul of federalism, was the distribution of legislative powers between the federation and the province, with its core being provincial autonomy---Interpretation of constitutional provisions should thus be in consonance with the said principle, rather than in a manner that encroached upon the space reserved for the provinces---Scope of an entry in the Federal Legislative List should not be expanded or enlarged in a manner that infringed provincial autonomy---Nature and character of the Constitution carried great significance and was of utmost relevance in construing the legislative entries and determining the scope and extent of the subjects assigned by it to the Federation and the Provinces---Court should therefore avoid an expansive construction of a federal legislative power which rendered redundant or nugatory the legislative field, power and authority assigned to the provinces, either expressly or as residuary, thus undermining provincial autonomy.  (k) Constitution of Pakistan---  ----Pt. II, Chapt. 1 [Arts. 8 to 25]---Fundamental rights, enforcement of---Obligation of State---State---Meaning---State had guaranteed the protection of Fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution---Nonetheless, one must resist conflating the State with the federal government as the provincial and also the local governments too constituted the State---State's obligation with regard to fundamental rights was, therefore, to be fulfilled and discharged by all tiers of the government and all organs of the State as per their power, authority, obligation, and competence, strictly as prescribed under the Constitution---Under no notion could any of the said governments be stripped of their rights, authority, or power, nor could they be exempted from discharging or fulfilling their prescribed obligations.  (l) Judgment---  ----Dissenting note---Significance and scope---While a dissenting note had no legal force, the purpose of such endeavour was to appeal to the brooding spirit of the law in the hope that what may be dissent today becomes the law tomorrow.

(a) Police Service of Pakistan (Composition Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985---     ----R. 11(2)(c)---Police officers from the Provinces encadred into the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP)---Seniority---Scope---Rule 11(2)(c) of Police Service of Pakistan (Composition Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985, was confined to determination of seniority amongst the encadred police officers from the Provinces---Where question of seniority arose either between those coming from the same Province or between officers encadred from different Provinces the same would be determined in accordance with R. 11(2)(c) of the said Rules---Rule 11(2)(c) of the Rules was thus to be restricted only to the determination of seniority in the encadred group and could not be made applicable for determining their seniority vis-a-vis the other two groups (i.e. officers inducted into the Police Service of Pakistan through initial appointment and those appointed in the Police Service of Pakistan from the Armed Forces).

(d) Qanun-e-Shahadat (10 of 1984)---  ----Art. 133---Examination of witnesses---Defence calling a prosecution witness as its own (defence) witness---Legality---Such practice was not acknowledged by law and could not be approved.

(On appeal against the judgment dated 13.03.2017 passed by the High Court of Sindh, Karachi in C.P. No. D-4291/2015) University of Karachi Service Pension Statute, 1972---  ----S. 26---Employee of University of Karachi---Entitlement of employee's widow to receive family pension---Minimum qualifying service---Claim of employee's widow for grant of family pension was denied for the reason that her husband had not put in the minimum qualifying service of ten years as envisaged under S. 26 of the University of Karachi Service Pension Statute, 1972---Legality---Right to claim pension was a right connected with the tenure of service which under the applicable pension rules had to be served by an employee in order to make him eligible for pension---Where a deceased employee had put in pensionable service, only then his family became entitled to pension---In order to claim pension, a minimum qualifying service was the threshold that had to be first crossed which would then entitle an employee or his family after his death to claim pension---Principle of completing minimum qualifying service was ingrained in every law that granted pension to the employees or after their death to their families---Said principle was based on 'quid pro quo', which mandated that an employee must put in minimum qualifying years of service before he became entitled to claim pensionary benefits---In the present case, admittedly the late husband of the appellant (widow) had put in only about five years of service, well short of rendering qualifying length of service to entitle her to family pension or any concession granted towards the quantum of pension---Appeal was dismissed accordingly.

LTD.---Respondent Civil Appeal No.1291 of 2005, decided on 27th April, 2016. (On appeal against the judgment dated 1-1-2003 passed by the High Court of Sindh, Karachi in Special Customs Appeal No.142 of 2002) (a) Customs Act (IV of 1969)---     ----S. 19---S.R.O. 484(I)/92 dated 14-5-1992---Import of 'plant and machinery'---Exemption from customs duty and sales tax---Off-Highway dump trucks imported by cement manufacturing company---Whether such trucks fell within the definition of 'plant'---Use of Off-Highway dump trucks at the quarries made them part and parcel of the industrial process of the cement company in question and their utility formed an integral function in the manufacturing of the cement---Direct nexus existed between the use of Off-Highway dump truck at the quarry of the cement manufacturing factory with its industrial process---Such nexus brought the Off-Highway dump truck within the definition of 'plant'---Irrespective of the fact that Off-Highway dump trucks were mobile vehicles, they were utilized to further the industrial process without which the industrial process of a cement factory would get interrupted and hindered at the very initial stage---Off-Highway dump trucks fell within the definition of the present company's cement plant.     Under S.R.O. 484(I)/92 dated 14-5-1992, plant and machinery, not manufactured locally, which were imported for setting up a new unit or for expansion or balancing, modernization and replacement of an already existing unit in certain areas was granted exemption from the whole of the customs duty and sales tax subject to fulfilling certain conditions. Cement company, in the present case, imported three Off-Highway dump trucks and claimed exemption from customs duty and sales tax under S.R.O. 484(I)/92 dated 14.05.1992 by contending that the Off-Highway dump trucks were imported for use in the industrial process of a cement factory, therefore, the same should be regarded as part of the plant and machinery of the cement factory.     Entire set of machines used in conjunction with other apparatus and electrical and mechanical equipment, required for undertaking and completing the cement industrial process, starting right from quarrying till the finished product that was produced was to be regarded as part of the plant of the cement company. In cement industry Off-Highway trucks were used at the quarries where the predominant raw-material in the cement production 'limestone' was won from the quarry by either extraction or blasting following which it was hauled on Off-Highway dump trucks to the place where the second stage in the cement manufacturing i.e. crushing of the raw-material took place. Thus there was direct nexus between the use of Off-Highway dump truck at the quarry of a cement manufacturing factory with its industrial process. Such nexus brought the Off-Highway dump truck within the definition of 'plant'. Off-Highway dump trucks could not be excluded from being treated as part of the plant of a cement factory, where their utility formed an integral function in the manufacturing of the cement. Irrespective of the fact that Off-Highway dump trucks were mobile vehicles, these trucks were utilized to further the industrial process without which the industrial process of a cement factory would get interrupted and hindered at the very initial stage.     Yarmouth v. France 1887 LIR 19 Q.B.D. 647 ref.     In the present case, the quarrying of materials was undertaken by one and the same enterprise which after completion of the remaining stages involved in the manufacturing of cement (crushing, blending, heating, cooling, clinkering and milling) ended with the portable cement being produced in bulk or bags for consumption. Cement company, in the present case seemed to be so designed that its' Off-Highway dump trucks involved in the industrial process were to be regarded as part of the 'plant' of the cement factory. Use of Off-Highway dump trucks at the quarries made them part and parcel of the industrial process of a cement factory and thus such trucks fell within the definition of the company's cement plant.     (b) Customs Act (IV of 1969)---     ----Ss. 19 & 30---S.R.O. 484(I)/92 dated 14-5-1992---S.R.O. 978(I)/95 dated 4-12-1995---Import of 'plant and machinery'---Exemption from customs duty and sales tax---Cut off date for SRO---Letter of credit for imported consignment opened within cut-off date mentioned in SRO, whereas consignment delivered at port after the cut-off date---Date on which 'Letter of Credit' was established or steps were taken in respect of import of consignment were not relevant and it was the date of import which determined applicability of the customs duty---In such circumstances importer-company was not entitled to seek exemption granted under S.R.O. 484(I)/92 dated 14-5-1992---However, the company was entitled to exemption to a limited extent by virtue of a different S.R.O. No. 978(I)/95 dated 4-12-1995 which exempted duties and charges over and above 25% of the leviable customs duty and sales tax and no more---Customs authority was justified in recovering customs dues and sales tax on the imported consignment accordingly.

Bank placed advertisement in a newspaper for the post of Management Trainee Officer. Respondents applied, passed the written test and were selected after their interviews, however, instead of issuing appointment letters, the Bank offered them a contract for on the job training as Management Trainee, for a period of two years. Instead of the word 'salary' word 'stipend' was used for their payment. Contract further provided that the same would not constitute employee/employer relationship between the trainee and the Bank; that training could be extended beyond the original period of two years, and that the training did not offer any guarantee of regular employment in the Bank. Upon expiry of their contracts after the prescribed period of two years, the contract of respondents were extended for a period of about seven months. However, neither was the employment of the respondents regularized nor were their contracts extended thereafter, and the Bank instead advertised vacancies for appointment in place of the respondents.  Applications that were invited by the Bank and made by the respondents were, to fill the positions of MTOs for operations of the Bank in Finance and Accounts and to catch the attention of the prospective candidates the phrase Career for Management Trainee Officers was printed on the top of the advertisement in bold letters. Further the offer/advertisement also promised payment of competitive remuneration. In response to the advertisement, the appellant-Bank received 8392 applications which were short listed to 1942. The candidates were further short listed for written test and thus 231 candidates were put to such test. Candidate securing 45% and above marks in the test were to be considered eligible for interview, however, keeping in view the vacancy position, only 30 candidates were called for interview conducted by the Designated Committee. On the recommendations of the Committee, the competent authority decided that the respondents may be considered for selection in the Head Office and the fields, and after that they may be preferred for posting in concerned zone with high merit. Trainees were to be accepted for on job training, initially for a period of two years and were to be considered for regular appointment on expiry of the contract period upon satisfactory performance and availability of vacancies and further that in case any management trainee failed to join, the next candidate with high merit may be offered the position for posting. Respondents were also required to furnish medical fitness certificate issued by the authorized medical practitioners.  Entire process commencing with the advertisement in newspaper and ending with the final selection and posting of the respondents, was a process of appointment to the post of officer and out of a large number of successful candidates, only 30 were inducted, as there were only such number of vacancies, however, the Bank instead of issuing appointment letters to the respondents made them sign contracts, which were clearly in conflict with the bank's promise of job to the eligible and selected candidates.  Respondents were posted in different branches of the Bank as Grade-II Officers, and as managers also. They were assigned the functions such as of sanctioning of loan, negotiating financial facility with the customers, evaluating securities, and recovery of the finance granted to the customers, and thus were functioning and discharging their duties with powers and authority as could have been done by any other officer/employee of the said grade in the Bank.  Bank had not claimed that there has been any complaint or dissatisfaction regarding the performance of the respondents. On the contrary, their performance had admittedly been satisfactory, and they had admittedly worked sincerely. Good performance of the respondents and their utility was also evident from the fact that upon expiry of the initial period their contracts were extended for a further term of about seven months.  Bank has had no mandate to conduct training for any individual other than its employees. Bank's claim that the respondents were selected merely for training and not for employment was in conflict with, rather beyond its mandate.  In the facts and circumstances of the present case, it was unfair to not confirm services of respondents. It was also against the interest of the bank to indulge in a fresh exercise of recruitment in place of the respondents which by itself shall be an expensive exercise both in terms of time, money and effort and so would be the ensuing training. Respondents had since their induction been performing their job satisfactorily, they had been trained by and for the Bank and had become familiar and acclimatized with the working and atmosphere of the Bank.  As regards the signing of the contract by the respondents, in a situation where the respondents after having been selected for a promised post, were offered a contract instead, and there being no equilibrium between the bargaining position of the respondents and the Bank, and keeping in view the rate of unemployment in the country, the respondents had no option but to sign the contract in order to avoid further disappointments and frustration by exposing themselves to unemployment. Signing of contracts by respondents, therefore, could not be allowed to be used as an obstructive instrument in their way of confirmation/regularization. Appeal was dismissed accordingly.

(On appeal against the judgment dated 20-6-2014 passed by the Election Tribunal-II, Quetta in Election Petition No. 28 of 2013)     (a) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----S. 70(b)---Ground for declaring election as a whole void---Allegation of corrupt and illegal practices---'Voting pattern' and 'voter turnout' in disputed and undisputed polling stations not phenomenally different---Principle laid down in the case of Khalid Hussain Magsi v. Mir Abdul Rahim Rind (2016 SCMR 900) would not apply in such circumstances to nullify the entire election result.     In the present case, there were 21899 registered votes in the disputed 25 polling stations and a total of 11570 votes were cast in these polling stations. The turnout at 25 disputed polling stations was 53% as against the turnout of 55% on the rest of the undisputed 48 polling stations. Thus it was apparent that on both the sets of polling stations no phenomenal difference in the polling pattern or the voters' turnout was noticeable.     If the voting pattern and the turnout of voters, on 25 disputed polling stations was compared with the voting pattern and the turnout on rest of the 48 polling stations, nothing phenomenal was noticeable to hold prevalence of corrupt practices so as to nullify the entire election result. Appeal was dismissed accordingly.     Khalid Hussain Magsi v. Mir Abdul Rahim Rind 2016 SCMR 900 distinguished.     (b) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----S. 70(b)---Ground for declaring election as a whole void---Votes from disputed polling stations sent to National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) for counterfoil verification report---Report showing unauthenticated / invalid / duplicate / bogus votes---Such votes should not be deducted from the tally of returned candidate's vote count as a principle without any substantial evidence available on record.     Deducting disputed votes mentioned in NADRA's counterfoil verification report from the tally of the votes cast in favour of returned candidate would mean laying down a principle that all disputed votes on a certain set of polling stations should be deducted from the vote-count of such candidate who had secured the highest number of votes in such polling stations, in absence of the evidence as to which of the contesting party was involved in corrupt practices. One could not rule out the possibility that a candidate may still loose though he may have himself indulged in rigging practices. Without any substantial material coming on record it should not be assumed that the winning candidate had indulged in rigging. Winning candidate may also come up with his own list of selected polling stations of the constituency where the runner-up candidate (or election petitioner) had secured the highest number of votes in order to seek verification and then get all the disputed votes, in case such were pointed out by NADRA, deducted from the tally of votes bagged by the runner-up candidate (or election petitioner).     NADRA's verification report, in the present case, relating to election material of only 25 polling stations could not be made basis for nullifying the entire election result of the constituency. There had to be some convincing material on record to reach the conclusion that the election as a whole needed to be declared void. Appeal was dismissed accordingly.     (c) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----S. 70(b)---Ground for declaring election as a whole void---Invalid votes---Counterfoil verification report prepared by National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA)---Counterfoils having invalid Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) numbers---NADRA's report, in the present case, stated that 748 used counterfoils had invalid CNIC numbers---Said report described invalid CNIC numbers to mean such counterfoils on which either CNIC numbers did not relate to the voters of the constituency or on which CNIC numbers were missing---NADRA's report did not say that on the 748 counterfoils thumb impressions were missing or that the thumb impressions were not verifiable---Whether thumb impressions on all or some of these 748 counterfoils were found to be correct was not known---If thumb impressions on any of the 748 counterfoils had matched with that of the voters of the constituency then such votes could not be described as invalid votes, irrespective of the fact that they contained incorrect CNIC numbers or CNIC numbers were altogether missing---Reason being that the possibility that the polling staff may have incorrectly written or omitted to write CNIC numbers on these 748 counterfoils could not be ruled out---Returned candidate could not be penalized for such an error or omission---Figure of 748 votes, as contained in NADRA's report, could not be treated as invalid votes that were cast at the behest of returned candidate---Appeal was dismissed accordingly.

(a) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----Ss. 67(1A) & 67(1)---Interpretation of S.67, Representation of the People Act, 1976---Election Tribunal---Adjudication of Election petitions----Expeditious disposal of election petitions---Mandatory nature of S.67(1A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976---Timely decisions were not being taken by the Election Tribunals; because, inter alia, Election Tribunals were ordinarily presided by Judges of the High Courts who remain unable to conclude matters expeditiously on account of their other judicial commitments, or because of delaying tactics employed by respondents who, having been declared as returned candidates, enjoyed the status of Members of the National or Provincial Assemblies---Such delays in disposal of election petitions before the Tribunal in fact deprived a large number of electors of the constituency to have their due representation in the elected Houses, particularly in those matters where a whole term had been enjoyed by a winning candidate, who may later turn out to be disqualified on any count---Such delay caused the people of constituency to be represented by a person who was not duly elected, which clearly negated the principle of a democratic system of Government---Wisdom existed in fixing the period for decision of such cases, namely, that there should be no uncertainty for the persons, who had been elected or who had challenged the election before the Tribunal or the Court and after expeditious disposal of the same and such persons should consume all their energies for the welfare of the people whom they represent, instead of wasting time in pursuing such matters before the Courts---Mandatory requirement of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 was that the Election Tribunal shall proceed with the trial of the election petition on a day-to-day basis and the decision thereof shall be taken within four months from its receipt as provided under S.67(1A) of the Act---Legal duty had, therefore, been cast upon the Election Tribunal to reach a conclusion expeditiously by following stringent/coercive measures of imposing a cost and assigning the reasons if cases were adjourned by the Tribunal and to such end, the Tribunal was even empowered to declare that a returned candidate who was delaying the proceedings of the Tribunal; ceased to be a member of the Parliament/Provincial Assembly, either till the conclusion of the proceedings or for such period as the Tribunal may direct---Provisions of S.67(1A) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 were therefore mandatory in nature and entailed penal consequences for non-compliance.

(b) Civil Procedure Code (V of 1908)---     ----Ss. 96, 104 & O.XLIII---Appeal---Appealable orders/decrees---Scope---Appeal was a statutory right, which would only be exercised if the statute had provided so as a matter of right---Under S.96, C.P.C. an appeal lay against all decrees passed by a court in exercise of original civil jurisdiction, except consent decree, and decree passed in a suit filed under S.9 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 and a final decree, the preliminary decree of which was not challenged--- Appeal also lay against an order if so provided for by S. 104 or O.XLIII, C.P.C.     (c) Administration of justice---     ----Judicial adjudication had to be undertaken by a forum duly authorized to exercise judicial powers and pronounce judgment between the parties.     (d) Qanun-e-Shahadat (10 of 1984)---     ----Art. 1(2) & Preamble---Domestic Tribunal etc.---Applicability of Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984 on proceedings before Domestic Tribunals, Inquiry Committees etc.---Scope---Domestic Tribunals, like inquiry committees, and departmental committees constituted statutorily by Universities to probe genuineness or otherwise of a degree, were bound by the principles of the Qanun-e-Shahadat, 1984.     Rahat Naseem Malik v. President of Pakistan 2003 PLC (C.S.) 759 rel.     (e) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----Ss. 67(3) & 67(1)---Constitution of Pakistan, Arts. 62 & 63---Decision of Election Tribunal---Appeal to the Supreme Court---Adjudication of such appeal by the Supreme Court---Scope---Adjudication in appeal proceedings by the Supreme Court at the apex level was distinct and different from decision/findings of Domestic Tribunals, not because of hierarchy but because of the statutory powers available to an appellate court under S.67 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976---Adjudication of an issue, which was a continuous bone of contention between the parties could not be postponed even if there was a lapse of a period of 10 years ; and particularly when a candidate had to prove his/her credentials in terms of Arts. 62 & 63 of the Constitution to establish that no objection/attack was actionable against him or her, both before as well as after entering the Parliament or the Provincial Assembly---Court could intervene in the election of such candidates, who were found to be disqualified, even after having been elected as members of Parliament, and their election could subsequently be de-notified.

(Against the judgment dated 14.12.2016 passed by the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad in Civil Revision No. 341 of 2016) (a) Specific Relief Act, (I of 1877)---  ----S. 42---Suit for declaration seeking change in date of birth---Change in date of birth only allowed in exceptional circumstances---Respondent, who was a student, filed a suit seeking a declaration that her date of birth in the Intermediate Secondary Education Certificate had been incorrectly recorded as 17-8-1992 whereas her correct date of birth was 17-8-1994---Held, that record contained Family Registration Certificate wherein the names of the respondent's siblings and their date of births were mentioned, Computerized National Identity Cards (CNICs) of the respondent and of her elder brother issued by NADRA, birth registration certificate of respondent's brother issued by the relevant authority and the birth certificate of the respondent issued by the Provincial Government---On all the said documents the date of birth of the respondent was mentioned as 17-8-1994 whereas the date of birth of her elder brother was 30-12-1992---Mother of the respondent produced documents relating to date of birth of the respondent's elder brother, which was mentioned as 30-12-1992---If the respondent's date of birth was taken as 17-08-1992, it was quite unbelievable that her elder brother, who was born on 30-12-1992, would have been born only four months after her birth and yet NADRA's record would reflect that her brother was elder than her---Respondent herself stated before the court that she was not an employee of any government or public institution---Supreme Court observed that it would not have allowed the correction in date of birth had the respondent been in the employment of any public, private or government service and was taking undue advantage of change in her date of birth, which might have prejudiced any right of others; that since no such situation arose in the present case, thus, the date of birth on her birth certificate, CNIC as well as in Family Registration Certificate issued by NADRA which was 17-8-1994 could not be ignored; that to ensure that the record did not reflect that the respondent's elder brother was born four months after her birth and to prevent any future dispute amongst her siblings with regard to inheritance and parentage, the Supreme Court was not inclined to interfere with the concurrent finding of courts below, whereby suit of respondent had been decreed---Appeal was dismissed.  (b) Specific Relief Act, (I of 1877)---  ----S. 42---Suit for declaration---Change in date of birth---Principles---Supreme Court discouraged changes in the date of birth which either could be for the purpose of unduly enhancing the tenure of service in any employment or to bring oneself within certain age limit in order to qualify for getting employed or seeking admission in an institution where age was relevant.

(On appeal against the judgment dated 28-5-2014 passed by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar, in W.Ps. Nos. 3857 and 4423 of 2010) (a) Civil service---     ----Promotion---Policy matter---Non-interference by courts---Eligibility criteria of promotion was essentially an administrative matter falling within the exclusive domain and policy decision making of the government and interference in such matters by the Courts was not warranted.     (b) Constitution of Pakistan---     ----Art. 199---Civil service---Promotion---Ouster of jurisdiction of High Court---No vested right of a government employee was involved in the matter of promotion or the rules determining their eligibility or fitness---High Court had no jurisdiction by means of Constitutional petition to strike down such rules.     The Central Board of Revenue, Government of Pakistan v. Asad Ahmad Khan PLD 1960 SC 81 and Muhammad Umar Malik and others v. Federal Service Tribunal and others PLD 1987 SC 172 ref.     (c) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Management Service Rules, 2007---     ----Sched. 1, S. No. 1---Civil service---Advertised posts---10% reserved quota for employees of ministerial staff restricted to employees of Civil Secretariat only (through amendment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Management Service Rules, 2007)---Policy decision of the Government---No mala fides attributable to the Government---Interference by courts not warranted in such circumstances.     Provincial Government advertised 53 posts in BPS-17 in the Provincial Management Service. Respondents who were serving in attached departments/subordinate offices of Provincial Government applied for the said posts under the 10% reserved quota for ministerial staff as per the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Management Service Rules, 2007. Subsequently the advertisement was withdrawn and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Management Service Rules, 2007 were amended to the effect that 10% reserved quota was restricted only to persons serving in the Provincial Civil Secretariat. Grievance of respondents was that discriminatory treatment was being given to them, as they were performing the same functions as that of Secretariat employees as such they could not be excluded from the 10% reserved quota because they fulfilled the qualification and experience.     Advertisement earlier made had subsequently been withdrawn and thereafter an amendment was made in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Management Service Rules, 2007 and as yet the employees had not appeared either in the examination or in any interview or selection, therefore, there appeared to be no vested right created in their favour, and accordingly any change made in the said Rules could not furnish a cause to the employees. Moreover, the amendment was made in the Rules in order to clarify certain anomalies, which had duly been taken care of, as such no mala fide could be attributed to the Government determination of eligibility of the employees through the amendment in question fully fell within the domain and policy decision of the Government which did not warrant interference by the Courts.

(Against the judgment dated 16-3-2005 passed by the High Court of Sindh, Karachi in Constitutional Petition D-739 of 1993 and D-754 of 1996.)

The employees of the contractor shall not be the employees of the company, if (a) they are under the control and management of the contractor, and not that of the company; (b) they are not on the pay-roll of the company and the management of the company is not even aware of the number of the workers employed by the contractor or about the terms and conditions of their appointment or service; and (c) the contractor has the power of hiring and firing the employees, and assigns works to them and the company has no concern with it.     The words employed by the factory are wide enough to include workmen employed by the contractors of the company. The employees of the contractor shall be the employees of the company, if the contractor engaged the workers for running of the affairs of the company and not for some other independent work, which has no concern with the production of the company; if the employees are working in a department of the company, which constituted one of the principal organs of the company, the machines belong to the company, the raw material is supplied by the company and the said department is controlled by the supervisors of the company, the employees of the contractor shall be the employees of the company; the employees engaged directly or through a contractor would be deemed to be the employees of the company for whose benefit they perform functions; even though control test is an important test, it is not the sole test; a multiple pragmatic approach weighing up all the factors for and against the employment has to be adopted, including an integration test; and if the contract is found to be not genuine and a device to deprive the employees from their legitimate rights/benefits, the so-called contract employees will have to be treated as employees of the company.     Normally, the relationship of employer and employee does not exist between a company and the workers employed by the contractor; however, in the case where an employer retains or assumes control over the means and method by which the work of a contractor is to be done, it may be said that the relationship of employer and employee exists between him and the employees of the contractor. Further, an employee who is involved in the running of the affairs of the company, under the direct supervision and control of the company, working within the premises of the company, involved directly or indirectly in the manufacturing process, shall be deemed to be employees of the company.     In the present case, the employees of the contractor are involved in running the affairs of the company such as filing and loading of urea bag as well as cleaning of machines and floors, therefore, for all intents and purposes, they are employees of the company through the contractor.

(On appeal from the judgment dated 30-9-2013 passed by the High Court of Balochistan, Quetta in C.P.No.265 of 2012). (a) Interpretation of statutes--- -----Punitive law curtailing liberty of person---While interpreting such  law, court was required to strive in search of an interpretation, which preferred the liberty of a person instead of curtailing the same and that too unreasonably and unfairly, unless, the statutory law clearly directed otherwise---If two equal interpretations were possible then the one favourable to the accused and his liberty must be adopted and preferred.     (b) Criminal Procedure Code (V of 1898)---     ----Ss. 35 & 397---Conviction of several offences at one trial or different trials---Sentences of imprisonment---Hardship case---Discretion of court--- Concurrent running of sentences-Provisions of Ss. 35 & 397 Cr.P.C. widened the scope of discretion the court to direct that sentences of imprisonment or that of life imprisonment awarded at the same trial or at two different trials but successively, shall run con currently---Once the legislation had conferred the said discretion in the court, then in hardship cases, courts were required to seriously take into consideration the same to the benefit of the accused so as to minimize and liquidate hardship treatment---Court of law could not fold up its hands to deny the benefit of Ss.35 & 397, Cr.P.C. to an accused person as denial would amount to ruthless treatment.

Workers' Welfare Fund (Employees Service) Rules, 1997 enacted by the Federal Government were adopted and made applicable to the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with clear directions and express approval of the Federal Government. For all intents and purposes said Rules had become applicable with full statutory force to the service and terms and conditions of service etc. of the employees of the Workers Welfare Board of the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.  Before the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, Ministry of Labour was within the domain of the Federal Government and once under its approval and direction the Workers Welfare Board has adopted the Workers' Welfare Fund (Employees Service) Rules, 1997, regulating the terms and conditions of service of its employees. After the Eighteenth Amendment, said Rules were exclusively within the domain of the Provincial Government/Workers' Welfare Board and unless the same was amended, repealed, modified or re-enacted under the changed Constitutional scenario, the same had a binding statutory force and the services of the employees of the Workers' Welfare Board of the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, were squarely and undoubtedly regulated by the said Rules.

37,"P L D 2016 Supreme Court 207 Present: Gulzar Ahmed and Dost Muhammad Khan, JJ Malik MUZAFFAR AHMED---Appellant Versus MAJLIS-E-ILMI SOCIETY through Muhammad Zubair---Respondent Civil Appeal No.1208 of 2011, decided on 15th December, 2015. (On appeal from the judgment dated 29-11-2010 passed by the Lahore High Court Lahore in Civil Revision No.29 of 2008) (a) Punjab Pre-emption Act (IX of 1991)--- ----S. 23(1)---Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pre-emption Act (X of 1987), S.23(1)(a)---No right of pre-emption in respect of 'sale' of waqf property or property used for charitable, religious or public purpose [section 23(1)(a) of Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991]---Inadvertent omission on part of draftsman in not adding the word`purchase' after the word 'sale' in S.23(1) of Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991---Word, purchase had been omitted from S.23(1) of Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 due to mistake, albeit inadvertently on the part of the drafter---Section 23(1) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pre-emption Act, 1987, which was similar to S.23(1) of Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 did contain the word 'purchase'---Words 'purchase', thus also had to be supplied to S.23(1) of Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 to render the said provision of law meaningful, so to give effect to the intent of the Legislature---Accordingly, the word purchase must be read in the provision of S.23(1) of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 and in the head-notes appended to it.   Section 23(1) of Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 provided that there was no right of pre-emption in respect of 'sale' of waqf property or property used for charitable, religious or public purpose, whereas a similar provision i.e. section 23(1) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pre-emption Act, 1987 provided that there was no right of pre-emption in respect of 'sale' or 'purchase' of waqf property or property used for charitable, religious or public purpose. Provision of section 23 of Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 suffered from absurdity, ambiguity and inadvertent omission on the part of the drafter because along with the word 'sale' the word, 'purchase' was not added.   Giving exemption from right of pre-emption to properties purchased by a charitable or religious institutions, was the clear intent and object of the Legislature because such purchased properties were used for charitable religious and public benefit and not for monetory or financial gain.   Word, purchase mentioned in section 23(1) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pre emption Act, 1987, had been omitted from the similar provision of section 23(1) of Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 due to mistake, albeit inadvertently on the part of the drafter, thus, it was fully justified to supply the omission, rendering section 23(1) of Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 meaningful, workable and sensible, so to give effect to the intent of the Legislature. Accordingly, the word purchase must be read in the provision of section 23 of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 and in the head-notes appended to it.   Supreme Court directed that Provincial Government should bring necessary amendments in the provision of section 23 of the Punjab Pre-emption Act, 1991 by adding the word, 'purchase' to avoid future unnecessary litigation in such regard.     (b) Interpretation of statutes ---     ----Inadvertent omission in a statute---Courts had the power to fill-up an omission/lacuna in a statute through necessary implied addition to give effect to the true meaning of the Legislature.   Where there was inadvertent omission on the part of the drafter in a statute and if interpretation on such account was placed in a way to give effect to the omission, not only would it defeat the intention of the Legislature but would also result in harmful drastic consequences.ln such a case it became imperative for the Courts to fill-up the gap and to supply the omission, so to avoid the obvious destructive effect on the true intent of the Legislature. In a case of ambiguity and absurdity or inadvertent omission, the Court had to make departure from the plain meaning of the statute and should adopt a construction, which furthered and carried the object of the Legislature into effect by resorting to drawing inference therefrom. Courts had the power to fill-up a lacuna in a statute through necessary implied addition.   In cases where there was a manifest contradiction of the apparent purposes of the enactment or the literal construction was likely to lead to a result not intended by the Legislature, the court had the power to modify the meaning of the words or to supply the obvious omission due to result of inadvertent mistake on the part of the drafter. In the cases of inadvertent legislative omissions, which defeated the very object of the whole scheme of law, the Courts had the powers to supply the omissions, making the statute purpose oriented, workable and sensible, by giving effect to the legislative intent.

(Against the judgment dated 9-12-2015 passed by the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad in Writ Petition No.3980 of 2015) (a) Criminal law--- ----Crime---'Aider and abettor' to the crime---'Beneficiary' of crime---Distinction---Person aiding or abetting another in an act was privy to the act itself but a beneficiary takes benefit or advantage of the act after the event and he may not necessarily be a party to the act itself.     General (R.) Parvez Musharraf v. Nadeem Ahmed (Advocate) and another PLD 2014 SC 585 ref.

In the present case Special Court had been constituted for trial of accused, who had allegedly committed the offence of high treason by issuing a Proclamation of Emergency in the country. Special Court ordered reinvestigation of the matter to trace whether certain co-accused persons and present- appellant, who was the then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, had aided and abetted the accused in committing offence of high treason. Constitutional petition filed by appellant against such order of Special Court was dismissed. Supreme Court observed that Federal Government had to consider the advisability or otherwise of getting a fresh investigation conducted for tracing out or identifying the aiders and abettors of the accused in the present matter. Special Court or the High Court could not require or approve a fresh investigation for such purposes.     Special Court had passed an earlier order whereby appellant was introduced in the case of high treason, but said order was set aside by the High Court. Despite setting aside of its earlier order the Special Court had reintroduced the appellant and two others as suspects in the case. After setting aside of its order the Special Court was left with no occasion whatsoever for reintroducing the appellant and two others as suspects in the case for the purposes of investigation qua their involvement in commission of the alleged offence. Conducting investigation into the matter was surely a prerogative of the Federal Government and the Special Court had no jurisdiction to direct the investigating agency to associate the appellant or any other particular person with such investigation.     There was no jurisdiction available with Special Court to direct an inquiry or investigation against a person or persons not formally complained against before the court. Apart from that an inquiry or investigation could be directed by the Special Court to be conducted before the issuance of process against the person complained against and not at a stage where the trial of the person complained against had already commenced and was nearing its conclusion, as in the present case.     Furthermore Supreme Court and High Court in various judgments had fixed the entire and exclusive responsibility of committing high treason upon the accused by stating that he had acted in his own discretion and for his own personal benefit. Supreme Court observed that as the trial of accused for the offence of high treason was presently pending before the Special Court, therefore, the present Bench of Supreme Court was restraining itself from recording its own opinions on the issue of aiders and abettors lest any opinion expressed may prejudice the case of the accused before the Special Court.

(b) Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005---  ----Rr. 7(3) & 7(4)---Private schools in province of Sindh---Tuition fees, increase in---Cap on increase in fees under R. 7 of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 (the Rules')---Said cap was not limited only to tuition fees as the lawmaker had not specifically used the word 'tuition fee' and instead used the word 'fee'---Interpreting 'fee' to mean 'tuition fee' only, would render the parts of the R. 7 redundant as it would open the possibility of institutions misusing R. 7(4) to exorbitantly increase any fee other than tuition fee in order to compensate for the reduction in income as a result of the cap, thereby essentially extracting tuition fee under the garb of a new head under R. 7(4)---Rule 7(4) seemed to apply to situations where institutions wished to add any new fee head to their fee structure/schedule subject to the approval of the Registering Authority---Once a new head was added, it too, would be subject to the conditions that it shall not be increased at any time during the academic year and only up to five percent of the last fee schedule, subject to proper justification and approval of the Registering Authority---Supreme Court directed that institutions were to ensure that all the conditions of admission and the approved fee schedule were printed on the prospectus or on the admission form and provided to the parents or guardians of students at the time of the admission, and that admission fee was charged from the student only at the time of his first admission into the institution which shall not be more than three months' tuition fees of the respective class in which the student was admitted.  (c) Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005---  ----R. 7(4)---Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Ordinance, 2001 (II of 2002), Preamble---Private schools in province of Sindh---Fee, charges or voluntary donation charged by institutions on account of any development project/activity---Costs of 'development project' and 'development activity'---Meaning---Such costs were to be borne by the institution---Since the terms 'development project' and 'development activity' had not been defined either in the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Ordinance, 2001, or the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005, as per the settled canons of interpretation, they shall be construed in accordance with their ordinary meaning which were projects or activities pertaining to construction, redevelopment, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of an institution's facilities.  (d) Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005---  ----R. 10---Private schools in province of Sindh---Minimum salary and allowances of a full-time teacher with twelve months of continuous service---Scope---Minimum salary of teachers under R. 10 of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 ('the Rules') was not a blanket rule as conditions had been provided in R. 10 itself---First, it was not only the salary but salary combined with allowances which must not be less than four times the monthly fee of a single student of the highest class charged by the institution; secondly, said rule only applied to full time teachers with twelve months of continuous service; and, thirdly, institutions run by trusts or communities were excluded from such requirement as they were only required to ensure that the pay scale of their teaching staff was at par with the respective Government pay scales.  (e) Constitution of Pakistan---  ----Art. 18---Freedom of trade, business or profession---Scope---Reasonable restrictions---Scope of Art. 18 of the Constitution and reasonable restrictions thereon as laid down by the Superior Courts stated.  Following is the scope of Article 18 of the Constitution and reasonable restrictions thereon as laid down by the superior Courts:  i. Article 18 conferred upon a citizen a right to freedom of trade, business or professions which was designed to enable the citizen to explore and adopt the best for his future, means of living and earning, and for the expression and recognition of his skills and abilities;  ii. However, said right was not absolute, unqualified or unfettered, but subject to regulation and reasonable restrictions which may be imposed by law in the larger interests of the society or for public welfare;  iii. The word 'qualification' had been used to confer a right upon a citizen to enter upon any lawful profession or occupation and not, to conduct any unlawful trade or business;  iv. The word 'lawful' qualified the right of the citizen in the relevant field and envisaged that the State could by 1aw ban a profession, occupation, trade or business by declaring it to be unlawful which in common parlance meant anything forbidden by law;  v. The provisions that a citizen 'possessing such qualifications, if any, as may be provided by law' and 'the regulation of any trade or profession by a system of licensing' empowered the Legislature and the authorities concerned to impose restrictions on the exercise of the right;  vi. Although 'reasonable restrictions' did not feature in Article 18, this did not mean that imposition of unreasonable restrictions was permissible under the Constitution;  vii. Licensing system was itself a restraint on trade, but the Constitution empowered the Government to impose reasonable restrictions. Reasonable restrictions authorized by the Constitution did not negate the Constitutional rights of a citizen to do business unhindered, without any condition;  viii. A reasonable classification was always considered to be within the framework of the fundamental right;  ix. The measure of reasonableness in the Constitution was provided by the concept of 'regulation', thus the restrictions should be consistent with the purpose of 'regulation' and not so unreasonable as to be in excess of it;  x. Reasonable restriction did not mean prohibition or prevention completely;  xi. If restrictions were to be imposed to regulate such trade or business, those should not be arbitrary or excessive in nature, barring a majority of persons to enjoy such trade;  xii. The restriction must be reasonable and bear true relation to 'trade' or 'profession' and for the purposes of promoting general welfare;  xiii. By qualifying the right to business and trade, the Constitution makers wanted to create a balance between the societal needs and the rights of an individual;  xiv. Under the Constitution, a proper balance was intended to be maintained between the exercise of the right conferred by Article 18 of the Constitution and the interests of the citizen in the exercise of his right to acquire, hold or dispose of his property to carry on occupation, trade or business. In striking that balance the danger which may be inherent in permitting unfettered exercise of a right must of necessity influence the determination of the restrictions which may be placed upon the right of the citizen;  xv. The validity of the prescribed qualifications or restrictions could be examined by the superior Courts in exercise of the power of judicial review on the touchstone of other fundamental rights, including Article 18 and other provisions of the Constitution and the law;  xvi. It must be shown in a concrete manner as to how the restrictions imposed were in excess of the object or the actual limits of regulation; and  xvii. If the restrictions appeared to be not only arbitrary but oppressive in nature and tended to deprive the citizens from enjoying the fundamental right of freedom of trade and business as per Article 18 of the Constitution, then it became the Court's duty to see the nature of the restrictions and procedure prescribed therein for regulating the trade and if it came to the conclusion that the restrictions were not reasonable then the same were bound to be struck down.

(g) Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance (IV of 1984)---  ----S. 7A [as amended by the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation)

in school fees under S. 7A of the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984 and R. 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005---Vires of---[Per Ijaz ul Ahsan, J (Majority view): While the citizens of the country had the right to conduct business relating to the private educational services industry in order to earn money, such right was not absolute or unfettered---By virtue of a licensing system, the State was empowered to regulate the exercise of such right and hence, could impose certain restrictions---Power to regulate included the power to regulate and control prices and matters related and incidental thereto---Such power had to be exercised fairly and reasonably and was justiciable on the touchstone inter alia of being unreasonable or arbitrary, the onus being on the person alleging un-reasonability or arbitrariness---Impugned laws in the Provinces of Punjab and Sindh [i.e. Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984 and Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005, respectively] both aimed to give the Government control over unrecognized private educational institutions by providing for a system of registration and to regulate various matters relating to private educational institutions including, but not limited to, school fees and staff salaries by the respective Government or Registering Authorities---Said laws had been put in place to curb the tendency on the part of private education sector to generate disproportionately large amounts of profit at the expense of students and their parents, as indicated by the Auditor General's report, through exploitation of the unfortunate situation where high quality education was scarce due to lack of resources or initiative on behalf of the State, therefore, it could not be said that these laws were akin to punishing the private sector for the delinquency of the State in providing education to the children of the country---Restrictions put in place by the impugned laws aimed to strike a balance between the exercise of the right to conduct business in the educational services industry by citizens on the one hand and the interests of the community, i.e. the students enrolled in private educational institutions and their parents and teachers, on the other---Furthermore, the restrictions placed by the impugned laws did not constitute complete prohibition or prevention---Revenue cap regulation was not a concept unknown to legal system of Pakistan---Whole purpose of revenue cap regulation was to limit the total amount of revenue that a firm operating in a particular industry with no or very few competitors could earn---In economic theory, such regulation was employed as an incentive to reach a desired outcome for society which in the present case was the provision of education that was accessible and did not become inaccessible by virtue of exorbitant and unreasonable increase in school fees---While such regulation could be adopted by governments and regulators in any industry, this was true more so for utilities and essential services that were intrinsically linked to fundamental rights in which the objective was availability and affordability of the utility or service while ensuring quality---In the present case, it was the right to education which was in issue and which had been recognized as a fundamental right under Arts. 9 & 25A of the Constitution---State had a duty to guarantee such right which it was aiming to do through revenue cap regulation---Private schools had not been able to show in a concrete and material manner as to how the cap on increase in fees had transgressed constitutional principles or was in excess of the object or the actual limits of the regulation---Since the schools failed to show that the impugned laws prima facie violated the right under Art. 18 of the Constitution as being outside the scope of reasonable restrictions, the burden never shifted onto the State to show that the said laws came within the permissible limits of reasonable restrictions---In the facts and circumstances of the case, the restriction in the form of caps in increase of fees was not unreasonable---Section 7A of the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984, as amended by the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) (Amendment) Act, 2017 was intra vires the Constitution and did not violate Arts. 18, 23, 24 or 25A thereof---Similarly R. 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 did not merit any interference---[Per Faisal Arab, J, dissenting only to the extent of R. 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 (Minority view): Only object of the law should be to check profiteering after students were admitted in schools, but when the fee of any particular service was regulated in a manner that had the potential of gradually eating-up legitimate margins of profit, it made businesses compromise on their quality lest they would run into losses which in turn led to layoffs or their eventual closure---To allow increase in tuition fee was not something that was to be equated with some concession or benefit granted by the State as it was mainly intended to compensate for the diminution in the purchasing power of currency of the country---Revision in tuition fee should be solely intended to meet the ever increasing cost of running of a school and at the same time persevering reasonable margin of profit---Limiting the raise in school fees to 5% only under R. 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 ('the 2005 Rules'), would be too harsh a financial restriction as it did not fully take care of the cost of running a school in comparison to the cost of its previous academic year---Such fact was evident from the value which the currency of the country had consistently been shedding in any five year period---Looking from such angle too, the arbitrarily determined cap of 5% imposed under R. 7(3) would certainly act as an unreasonable restriction on carrying on a lawful business---Inbuilt cumbersome process to seek increase in tuition fee under R. 7(3) also amounted to unreasonable restriction---In view of the arbitrary cap of 5% increase in fee imposed by R. 7(3), there was a strong possibility that many of the private schools in Sindh at a certain point in time may not be able to fully absorb the increase in the cost of running a school or the cost of the facilities provided to the students---Consequently the existing private schools may start closing down or the number of their branches may dwindle which in turn would make it very difficult to cope with the ever increasing demand for good quality educational institutions---In the present case no one had argued that any cartel existed that did not leave much choice with the parents but to admit their children in a particular set of school systems only, therefore, there existed no monopoly in the fixation of tuition fees---Raising the cap of 5% provided in R. 7(3) to an automatic increase upto 8% in an academic year without recourse to Registering Authority would bring it closer to the ground realities and within the limits of reasonableness and at the same time save the department and the schools much of the inconvenience in the periodical revision of tuition fees---His Lordship directed the [Sindh] Provincial Government to amend R. 7(3) of the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005 accordingly within a period of two months]  Muhammad Kowkab Iqbal and another v Government of Pakistan through Secretary Cabinet Division, Islamabad and others PLD 2015 SC 1210;

Following are the directions given by the Supreme Court with respect to cap on increase in school fees:  (i) Through an interim order dated 30-12-2018 the Supreme Court had directed all educational institutions receiving fees in excess of Rs.5,000/- per month to reduce their fee by 20%. Said amounts equivalent to 20% of fee(reduced under the interim order) or any other amount shall not be recovered as arrears for any reason or under any circumstances.  (ii) Since schools had excessively increased fees since the year 2017 in violation of the law, all such increases were to be struck down. It would be deemed that there was no increase in fee since 2017 and fees were frozen at the rates prevailing in January, 2017.  (iii) Schools fees should be recalculated using the fee prevailing in 2017 as the base fee in accordance with the provisions of the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984 and the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005, respectively (adding annual increases permitted by the law/rules/regulations) till 2019 and onwards. The process of recalculation shall be supervised by the regulators and only the fee approved by them shall be treated as the chargeable fee.  (iv) Any excess fee found to have been charged shall be adjusted in the future fee.  (v) The Regulators shall closely monitor the fee being charged by private schools to ensure strict compliance with the law and the rules/regulations. Complaint cells shall be setup to deal with complaints arising out of increase in fee in violation of the law/rules/regulations.  (vi) All schools shall collect the fees, strictly in accordance with the procedure and timeframe provided by the law, the rules and regulations including, but not limited to the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) Ordinance, 1984, as amended by the Punjab Private Educational Institutions (Promotion and Regulation) (Amendment) Act, 2017 and the Sindh Private Educational Institutions (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2005.

Col. (R) Ghazanfar Abbas Shah v. Khalid Mehmood Sargana (2015 SCMR 1585)---Election petition in the present case had not been duly verified in accordance with law and even the affidavit annexed thereto could not be considered as verification of the petition as the affidavit failed to meet the criteria laid down by the Supreme Court, therefore, the election petition merited outright dismissal by the Election Tribunal.     Verification of an election petition in the manner prescribed under section 55(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 was a mandatory requirement and that too in accordance with the provisions of Order VI, Rule 15, C.P.C.     Zia ur Rehman v. Syed Ahmed Hussain and others 2014 SCMR 1015 and Sardarzada Zafar Abbas and others v. Syed Hassan Murtaza and others PLD 2005 SC 600 ref.     Record of the present case showed that the petitioner while filing his election petition did not comply with the mandatory requirements with regard to the verification of the election petition and to cure such defect subsequently submitted an affidavit in this regard, wherein the entire contents of his election petition were reproduced.     When the affidavit was examined in the light of the pre-requisites for a valid affidavit laid down in the case of Lt. Col. (R) Ghazanfar Abbas Shah v. Khalid Mehmood Sargana (2015 SCMR 1585), it transpired that certain essential requirements were missing. Firstly, it had not been mentioned whether the petitioner was administered oath by the Oath Commissioner before the attestation was made. Secondly, it had not been specified whether the petitioner was duly identified before the Oath Commissioner. In this regard, it had simply been stated at the foot of the affidavit that the petitioner was present before the Oath Commissioner in person, however, the details of the person identifying the petitioner had not been mentioned whereas according to pre-requisites in Lt. Col. (R) Ghazanfar Abbas Shah case (2015 SCMR 1585), the Oath Commissioner was bound to specify at the foot of the affidavit the name and description of the person by whom identification of the deponent was made and in this regard a certificate had to be appended. Furthermore, it was also not clear from the affidavit that the petitioner was identified with reference to his Identity card and in this regard, no Identity card number was given, as such the identification did not seem to have been made. Further the affidavit in question did not make any reference to the numbered paragraphs contained therein which the petitioner verified of his own knowledge and what he verified upon information received and believed to be true. Moreover, the affidavit in question also did not make any reference to the verification of the annexures appended along with the petition, which although had been mentioned in the said affidavit.     Lt. Col. (R) Ghazanfar Abbas Shah v. Khalid Mehmood Sargana 2015 SCMR 1585 ref.     Election petition, in the present case, had not been duly verified in accordance with law and even the affidavit annexed thereto could also not be considered to be proper verification of the petition as the affidavit failed to meet the criteria mentioned in the Lt. Col. (R) Ghazanfar Abbas Shah case (2015 SCMR 1585). Election petition merited outright dismissal by the Election Tribunal in such circumstances.     (b) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----S. 52---Election petition---Objection with regard to maintainability of an election petition for non-compliance of a mandatory provision---Election Tribunal should decide such an objection first because if such objection sustained then the Tribunal was left with no option but to dismiss the election petition.

No. 1575 of 2004) (a) Gift---     ----Gift deed, authenticity of---Prerequisites for valid gift i.e. offer, acceptance and delivery of possession not proved---Non-examination of attesting witnesses of gift deeds---Interested witnesses presented to prove execution of purported gift deeds---Non-production of original gift deeds along with the plaint---Evidence of Hand Writing Expert not helpful in circumstances where photostat copies of purported gift deeds were used for comparing signatures---Possibility of manipulation/substitution/subsequent addition of attesting witnesses could not be ruled out---Gift deeds could not be termed as valid in such circumstances     Three important prerequisites for valid gift i.e. offer, acceptance and delivery of possession had not been proved by the plaintiff and her witnesses in the present case.     Before the institution of suit by the plaintiff, the two purported gift deeds in her favour had not seen the light of the day in any manner/government record. Had the present case been a case of genuine gift in favour of plaintiff then there was no justification for her to withhold production of purported gift deeds for such a long period before filing the suit when all the attesting witnesses except one, had expired. Marginal witness of one of the purported gift deeds affirmed the fact that it was not signed by donor in presence of any person. Further, defendant was the only surviving legal heir of donor. Defendant was a minor at the time of donor's death and when she became major and agitated her claim over the suit house, plaintiff came out with the story of two gift deeds to legitimize her exclusive claim over the suit house. Original gift deeds were not produced along with the plaint even at evidence stage. Attesting witnesses of the two gift deeds were not examined. Evidence of witnesses appearing for the plaintiff was also of no help to the case of plaintiff to prove the authenticity or genuineness of the purported gift deeds.     Evidence of certain witnesses appearing on behalf of plaintiff revealed that they were interested witnesses installed for the purpose of justifying the execution and genuineness of the purported gift deeds. However, they also failed as their evidence was not confidence inspiring enough to prove the execution of purported gift deeds. Evidence of Hand Writing Expert was of no avail as all the documents sent to him; firstly, came from the possession of the plaintiff; secondly, the comparison of photostat copies with the originals was not warranted by law; and lastly such exercise was not a conclusive proof about the genuineness of one of the purported gift deeds.     Instead of following usual practice of having two attesting witnesses of purported gift deeds, they contained attestation by four witnesses at a time. For such reason too possibility of manipulation/ substitution/subsequent addition of other two witnesses could not be ruled out. Purported gift deeds could not be held to be valid in such circumstances.     (b) Registration Act (XVI of 1908)---     ----Ss. 17 & 49---Oral gift, authenticity of---Unregistered gift deed executed between the donor and donee as an acknowledgment of past transaction of oral gift---Non-registration of such gift deed would not have much bearing as regards its authenticity or validity, however three important prerequisites for valid gift i.e. offer, acceptance and delivery of possession, had to be proved for such transaction to be valid.

Rajya v. Gopikabai AIR 1979 SC 79 ref.     (c) Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Reorganization and Conversion) Ordinance (LX of 2002)---     ----S. 6--- Legislation by reference--- Scope--- Section 6 of Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (Reorganization and Conversion) Ordinance, 2002 was an instance of legislation by reference.     (d) Legislation---     ----Legislation by reference---Scope---Legislation by referential incorporation fell into two categories; first, where a statute by specific reference incorporated the provisions of another statute as of the time of adoption; second, where a statute incorporated by general reference the law concerning a particular subject as a genus---In the case of former category, the subsequent amendment made in the referred statute could not automatically be read into the adoption statute---In the case of latter category, it might be presumed that the legislative intent was to include all the subsequent amendments also made from time to time in the general law on the subject adopted by general reference.

(e) Interpretation of statutes---     ----Legislation by reference---Scope---Statute which referred to law of a subject generally adopted the law on the subject as of the time the law was invoked; and this would include all the amendments and modifications of the law subsequent to the time the reference/statute was enacted.     Rajya v. Gopikabai AIR 1979 SC 79 ref.     (f) Delegated legislation---     ----Rules and regulations framed under an Act by statutory bodies---Scope---Rules and regulations framed under any Act were meant to regulate and limit the statutory authority---All statutory authorities or bodies derived their powers from statutes which created them and from the rules or regulations framed thereunder---Any order passed or action taken which was in derogation or in excess of the powers of statutory authority or body, could be assailed as ultra vires---Statutory bodies were invariably authorized under the Act to make or adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with the Act, with respect to such matters which fell within their lawful domain to carry out the purposes of the Act.     (g) Delegated legislation---     ----Reasons justifying need for delegated legislation---Firstly, there is pressure on parliamentary time; secondly, the technicality of subject matter necessitates prior consultation and expert advice on interests concerned, and thirdly, the need for flexibility is established because it is not possible to foresee every administrative difficulty that may arise to make adjustment that may be called for after the statute has begun to operate.

Following are the salient characteristics of statutory rules or regulations:--     (i) Rules or Regulations are framed by statutory or public body;     (ii) they are framed under the authority or powers conferred in the statute; and     (iii) they have statutory Governmental approval or statutory sanction.     (i) Constitution of Pakistan---     ----Art. 199--- Constitutional Jurisdiction of High Court--- Scope---Employee of statutory/public authority governed by statutory rules---Statutory authority passing order relating to the employee in violation of statutory rules---Interference by High Court in its constitutional jurisdiction---Scope---Statutory rules created certain rights for employees and imposed obligations on the statutory authorities---Statutory authorities and functionaries could not deviate or act in derogation to such rules or regulations---Any order passed or action taken by a public authority which was in conflict with such statutory rules could be challenged under Art. 199 of the Constitution.

52," P L D 2016 Supreme Court 79 Present: Mian Saqib Nisar, Iqbal Hemeedur Rahman and Maqbool Baqar, JJ Syed HAFEEZUDDIN---Appellant Versus ABDUL RAZZAQ and others---Respondents Civil Appeal No. 1086 of 2014, decided on 19th November, 2015. (Against the judgment dated 7-8-2014 of the Election Tribunal, Karachi passed in Election Petition No.7 of 2013) (a) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)--- ----Ss. 68 & 69---Grounds for declaring a person other than a returned candidate elected---Scope---Onus on runner-up candidate/any contesting candidate to prove his entitlement to be declared as the winner instead of the returned candidate---Declaration to such effect could not be made by Election Tribunal as a matter of course, and runner-up candidate/any contesting candidate must prove his entitlement to be declared returned candidate by setting out his own reasons and positive evidence to such effect.   Once any of the grounds enumerated in section 68 of Representation of the People Act, 1976, had been established through quality evidence (by the petitioner/runner-up candidate), the obvious consequence as per the law shall thus be to declare the election of returned candidate as void. While passing such order the Tribunal under section 69 of the said Act was duly empowered to declare the election petitioner/runner-up candidate or any of the contesting candidates as the returned candidate, but it may make such declaration only if a claim in such regard had been set out by them. Furthermore, such declaration shall not be made as a matter of course or a right or ipso facto rather only in the circumstances of the case where the election petitioner or the respondent of the election petition was able to substantiate and make out a case qua his entitlement to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. Such entitlement shall be dependant on the facts and circumstances of each case; the reasons set out and proof for the entitlement thereof. Thus the grant of relief to the election petitioner or any other respondent in the election petition under the provisions of section 69 of Representation of the People Act, 1976, must be proved on the strength of their own entitlement to get elected in place of the returned candidate.

(b) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----Ss. 68, 69 & 70---Grounds for declaring a person other than a returned candidate elected---Grounds for declaring election as a whole void---Scope---While considering the parameters of S.69 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976, particularly with respect to the runner up candidate (and not any of the other candidates) and where the returned candidate had been found to be disqualified and his election had been declared as void, it was not the case that the votes of the returned candidate (who had been disqualified and whose election as a returned candidate had been declared to be void under S.68) were to be simply disregarded or discarded on the doctrine of throw away votes and the runner up was to be automatically declared as the duly elected returned candidate by virtue of having secured the next highest number of votes; rather the notoriety of the disqualification amongst the voters at the time of polling had to be examined and if the disqualification was found to be notorious (apparent or known to the public), only then could the votes of a winner of an election be thrown away, and the runner up be declared to be the duly elected returned candidate---Where the disqualification was not notorious and depended on legal argument or upon complicated facts and inferences, then the runner up could not be declared to be the duly elected returned candidate, as the possibility could not be ruled out that any of the other candidates could have won the elections, hence the election must be declared to be void as a whole and fresh elections must take place.

S. M. Ayub and 2 others PLD 1973 SC 160) ref.     (d) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----Ss. 38(9), 68 & 83(b)---Lapses/anomalies committed by Presiding Officer of a polling station benefiting the returned candidate---No direct evidence to prove that returned candidate obtained or procured the assistance of the Presiding Officer to secure his election---No inference could be drawn in absence of positive evidence that such lapses were done in connivance or collusion with the returned candidate---Possibility existed that the lapses committed by the Presiding Officer were bona fide mistakes or due to lack of proper skill and adequate knowledge or expertise---Lapses on part of Presiding Officer could not be termed as 'illegal practices' in such circumstances---Since there was doubt with respect to proof of the allegations of illegal practice and connivance and collusion, the benefit of such doubt should be given to the returned candidate---Election of the returned candidate was not liable to be declared as void under S.68 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976.     Allegation against the Presiding Officer of a polling station was that she did not fill up the statement of count; that the runner-up candidate's name was not mentioned in the statement of count; that she signed hand-written results and provided them to the polling agents of the runner-up candidate in which the count was different from that in Form-XIV, and that statement of count pertaining to the votes cast in favour of the candidate of the National Assembly was absolutely different from the votes of the Provincial Assembly.     Perusal of evidence given by the Presiding Officer in question suggested that she admitted to overwriting on figures in Form-XIV to make corrections; admitted to writing the figure 1,600 on one page of Form-XIV of polling station in question and the figure 1,700 on the other page; admitted to the errors in calculation while attributing it to absence of a calculator and lack of sufficient light due to a power breakdown; admitted that the Form-XIV was not entirely prepared by her, in that the candidates' names were written by the Assistant Presiding Officer, but the rest including her name and signature were in her own handwriting; and that she attributed the absence of the runner-up candidate's name from the Form-XIV to the fact that she was not aware that he was contesting from the said constituency. Even if such lapses occurred, they certainly did not fall within the definition of illegal practice contained in section 83(b) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976, as they did not constitute obtaining or procuring or attempting to obtain or procure the assistance of any person in the service of Pakistan to further or hinder the election of candidate. With regard to the argument that the Presiding Officer had prepared her affidavit in the returned candidate's office and did not appear as an official witness which fact indicated connivance and collusion with the returned candidate, they were mere inferences, which were neither positive nor conclusive evidence of the fact that she colluded and connived with the returned candidate, and that he obtained or procured the assistance of the Presiding Officer to secure his election as a returned candidate. Argument of runner-up candidate regarding the difference between the statements of count of National and Provincial constituencies, which purportedly reflected that Presiding Officer had committed an illegality vis-a-vis the proper count and preparation of Form-XIV, was a plain inference, not backed by sufficient evidence.     Runner-up candidate conceded that there was no evidence to directly prove that there was connivance between the returned candidate and the Presiding Officer, and that his allegations were based on inferences which should be necessarily drawn because of the conduct of the Presiding Officer.     Sardar Abdul Hafeez Khan v. Sardar Muhammad Tahir Khan Loni and 13 others 1999 SCMR 284 distinguished.     Even if an inference was to be drawn, it could only be so done where there was only one possible conclusion that could be reached, warranting proof through circumstantial as opposed to direct evidence. Fact that certain lapses/anomalies were committed by the Presiding Officer of a polling would not automatically lead to the conclusion that such was done in connivance or collusion with or on the instructions of the returned candidate. There was the possibility that the lapses committed by the Presiding Officer were bona fide mistakes or due to lack of proper skill and adequate knowledge or expertise as to how to do the needful, or as a result of miscalculation of votes or lack of sufficient light due to a power breakdown. Possibility could not be ruled out that any one of the candidates in the election colluded with the election staff at one polling station and had certain violations of the election law committed such as the wrong filling up of Form-XIV and by taking premium and advantage of their own fraud ultimately used this as a tool for having the election of the returned candidate declared as void. Since there was more than one possibility as to what could have happened on the day of election vis- -vis counting of votes and preparation of statement of count, one could not draw such inferences.     Runner-up candidate was required to produce strict positive evidence in order to prove its serious allegations of illegal practice against the returned candidate. Evidence on record clearly suggests that there was doubt with respect to proof of the allegations of illegal practice and connivance and collusion, the benefit of which should have been given to the returned candidate. To hold, in the circumstances, that the returned candidate had obtained or procured the assistance of the Presiding Officer would be against the spirit of the law and against the settled norms of justice.     Since the lapses on part of Presiding Officer did not constitute illegal practices as contemplated by the provisions of section 83 of the Representation of the People Act, 1976, the election of the returned candidate was not liable to be declared as void under section 68 of the said Act. Appeal was allowed accordingly.     (e) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----Ss. 38(9) & 70(a)---Grounds for declaring election as a whole void---Scope---Lapses/anomalies committed by Presiding Officer of a polling station in relation to preparation of statement of count---Such lapses/anomalies did indicate a failure on behalf of Presiding Officer to comply with the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1976, but it did not materially affect the election---Even if votes of the disputed polling station were excluded from the total vote count of the returned candidate, he still had winning margin---Election as whole could not be declared as void in such circumstances.     Section 70(a) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976, provided for declaration of the election as a whole void if there was a failure of any person to comply with the provisions of the said Act or the Rules, provided that the election had been materially affected by such failure. Lapses/anomalies committed by the Presiding Officer of a polling station in the present case may at best indicate a failure on her behalf to comply with the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1976, particularly section 38(9) which provided for preparation of statement of count by the Presiding Officer, thus the (first part of the) test that there must be a failure of any person to comply with the provisions of the Act/Rules, may be satisfied in the present case. However the second part of the test i.e. such non-compliance must have materially affected the election, was not satisfied in the present case. Even if (all the) 1400 votes of the disputed polling station were excluded from the total count of the returned candidate's votes of 15,432, reducing it to 14,032, the returned candidate would still win by a margin of 3,072 votes. Therefore, as the election would not be materially affected, there was no occasion to declare the election as a whole to be void under section 70(a) of the Representation of the People Act, 1976.

(Against the order dated 24.4.2013 passed by the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi Bench in C.R. 368-D of 2003) (a) Islamic law---  ----Inheritance---Sect of deceased---Proof---Voluntary declaration of deceased in court proceedings regarding her faith---Persuasive value---In previous court proceedings regarding faith of her son, the deceased had voluntarily declared herself to be 'Shia'---No reason was found to disbelieve the declaration of deceased in respect of her own faith which neither was challenged nor it could successfully be challenged even if one was allowed to cross-examine the person who declared his/her faith---In the present case, on the factual plane the veracity of the statement of the deceased wherein she declared her faith throughout had not been challenged---Appellant had never claimed that the deceased did not appear in a witness box or she did not on oath declare herself to be Shia by faith---No better evidence could be made available to the Court than the declaration of such person to resolve the controversy regarding his/her faith---Question of faith being very personal to oneself and a declaration of faith by one had to be accepted on its face value which, of course, was not open to challenge from anyone, therefore, such voluntary declaration even if made in some previous proceeding was of great persuasive value after the death of such person and, therefore, could be validly used in the subsequently instituted proceedings to determine the faith of such person.  (b) Islamic law---  ----Inheritance---Sect of deceased, determination of---General principle of presumption---Scope---in Indo-Pak sub continent majority of Muslims were Sunni by faith, therefore, there was initial presumption that the parties to the proceedings were Sunni, however, such initial presumption was rebuttable---No principle of universal application was available to determine the faith of a person which should be determined keeping in view the surrounding circumstances, the way of life, the parental faith and faith of other kith and kin---Consequently once the faith of a person was challenged the question of the initial presumption lost its sanctity and was to be inferred from the facts creating presumption or the surrounding circumstances one way or the other.  Muhammad Bashir v. Latifa Bibi 2010 SCMR 1915 ref.  (c) Islamic law---  ----Inheritance---Sect of deceased---Proof---Presence of 'Alam' in house---Arranging 'Majlis'---Important piece of evidence which persuaded the Courts below in deciding the faith of deceased was the hoisting of 'Alam' of Hazrat Abbas at her house---Such fact was admitted by none other than plaintiff's own attorney/witness during his cross-examination---Such act of hoisting Alam was a strong indication of the fact that the resident of the house was Shia by faith---Plaintiff's attorney being nephew of the deceased did not deny two very important facts; firstly, that Alam of Hazrat Abbas was hoisted on the house of deceased and; secondly, that deceased used to hold Majlis at her house---Courts below had rightly evaluated the evidence on record in coming to the conclusion that the deceased was Shia by faith---Appeal was dismissed accordingly.

(b) Constitution of Pakistan---     ----Art. 199---Constitutional petition before High Court by an employee of a statutory body--- Maintainability---Function test---Scope---Courts generally apply the function test to consider whether a statutory body was a person within the meaning of Art. 199 of the Constitution.

Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Defence and others (PLD 2006 SC 602), could invoke Art.199 of the Constitution against order of departmental authority---Although rules/regulations of statutory organizations in question might have been non-statutory but there was a statutory intervention in the shape of Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 and the employees had to be dealt with under the said law---Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 had an over-riding effect and after its promulgation (27th of May 2000), all disciplinary proceedings which had been initiated under the said Ordinance and any order passed or action taken in disregard to the said law was amenable to constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court under Art. 199 of the Constitution---Legislative intent in the promulgation of Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000, inter alia, was that service matters for persons in corporation service should be dealt with in accordance with provisions of said law and to ensure a fair trial it was inter alia provided in the said Ordinance that unless specifically exempted by a reasoned order, the competent authority shall hold a regular enquiry against an employee accused of misconduct, and that he shall have a right of appeal (section 10 of the Ordinance)---Subsequently employees were deprived of their right of appeal as the same was held to be ultra vires of the Constitution by the Supreme Court in the cases of Muhammad Mubeen-us-Salam and others v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Defence and others (PLD 2006 SC 602), and Muhammad Idrees v. Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan and others (PLD 2007 SC 681)--- Deprivation of such right of appeal would amount to judicial sanctification of all orders passed by departmental authorities awarding various penalties to employees and would also be violative of fundamental right to fair trial and due process as ordained in Art. 10A of the Constitution---Employees in question could invoke Art. 199 of the Constitution to seek due compliance of Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 in such circumstances---Impugned judgment of High Court was not open to exception---Appeal was dismissed accordingly.

(g) Judgment---     ----Conflicting judicial opinions---Judgments having conflicting judicial opinions---Stare decisis, principle of---Applicability---Scope---Factors to be kept in view by the Supreme Court while attempting to resolve such a conflict.     In an attempt to resolve a conflict of judicial opinion, the Supreme Court must keep in mind, first, the purpose of law the court was called upon to interpret; second, the fact that law was a living organism which adapted to societal change and sometimes change in law preceded the former; third, the ambit of court's jurisdiction and its limitations as defined in the Constitution; fourth, that the court must be consistent i.e. in similar situations/cases, judicial opinion should be similar, and fifth, that though Supreme Court was not bound by the principle of stare decisis, but departure from the precedent should be well reasoned, proper and in accordance with the established principles of law.     (h) Appeal---     ----Scope---Right of appeal was a substantive right.     (i) Appeal---     ----Appeal was continuation of trial.

No. 140 of Vol. 1 of the Esta Code which prescribed the, Procedure Regarding Appointments in Autonomous/Semi-Autonomous Bodies, under the Federal Government---Section 6(2) of the Ordinance set out the qualifications of Chairman, PEMRA who, shall be an eminent professional of known integrity and competence having substantial experience in media, business, management, finance, economics or law---Appellant could not be categorized as an eminent professional having substantial experience in any of the areas mentioned in S.6(2) of the Ordinance---Rules of natural justice were fully complied by the inquiry officer; show cause notice was served upon the appellant, and reply submitted by the appellant was duly considered---Inquiry officer provided more than one opportunity of personal hearing to the appellant but he did not avail such opportunities---Inquiry report recommended the dismissal of the appellant from the position of Chairman, PEMRA and the Prime Minister accepted his recommendation and advised the President to remove him and the President accepted his advice---Appeal filed by appellant against his dismissal as Chairman, PEMRA was dismissed accordingly.

Motion for leave for review, in the present case, was heard by three Members of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Authority). Respondent-Electric Supply Company argued that Rule 16(6) of National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Tariff Standards and Procedure) Rules, 1998 provided that  a party may file a motion for leave for review by the full strength of the Authority , which meant that review was to be decided by 'full strength' i.e. five Members of the Authority, whereas in the present case it was heard and decided by only three Members (including the Vice Chairman).     Section 5(2) of the Act provided in clear terms that three members shall constitute a quorum for meetings of the Authority requiring decisions by the Authority. Section 5(1) of Regulation of Generation, Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power Act, 1997 (Act) provided that meeting of the Authority shall be presided over by the Chairman or, in his absence, the Vice Chairman. At the time when the decision on Motion for Leave to Review was handed down, in the present case, the Authority was comprised of two Members and a Vice Chairman, which met the minimum requirement of three members quorum set down in terms of section 5(2) of the Act.     Phrase full strength, within the contemplation of Rule 16(6) of the Rules meant strength as set down in the Act itself, i.e. minimum of three members within the contemplation of section 5(2) of the Act. Said Act did not admit of any classification of Authority viz. statutory strength (i.e. all five Members including the Chairman), and none should be created when the parent statute/Act did not permit so.

60,"2016 S C M R 816 [Supreme Court of Pakistan] Present: Ejaz Afzal Khan, Sardar Tariq Masood and Faisal Arab, JJ COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX, PESHAWAR---Appellant Versus Messrs ISLAMIC INVESTMENT BANK LTD.---Respondent Civil Appeal No. 1086 of 2009, decided on 16th December, 2015. (On appeal against the order dated 29-1-2009 passed by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in T.R. No. 48 of 2007) (a) Interpretation of statutes---     ----Repealed statute---Provisions of a repealed statute preserved by a saving clause in the repealing statute---When a statute repeals an earlier statute and it was an unqualified repeal, then the effect of such repeal was that the earlier statute got repealed in its entirety---However, where the Legislature intended to preserve any power or inchoate right in relation to the repealed statute, then a saving clause was incorporated in the repealing statute whereby certain provisions were preserved from getting repealed to the extent and with regard to the subject mentioned in the saving clause---Provisions of the repealed law that were so preserved were to be regarded as if the repealed statute was still in operation.     (b) Income Tax Ordinance (XLIX of 2001)---     ----S. 239(1)---Income Tax Ordinance (XXXI of 1979) [since repealed], Preamble---Section 239(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 as a saving clause---Scope---Section 239 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, by its very nature, being a saving clause, was intended to preserve certain powers and procedures contained in the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Several procedures for the correct assessment of income and determination of tax liability were devised in the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Section 239(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, in fact saves the entire set of procedures prescribed under the repealed law [Income Tax Ordinance, 1979] through which the exercise of reaching at the correct calculation of total income and the tax payable thereon could be undertaken with regard to the periods covered under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Section 239(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 encompassed within its ambit all types of assessments that could be made to a tax return---In simple terms, assessment was relatable to all stages of assessments that could be made to a tax return under the provisions of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Replacement of old law with a new one was never intended to affect the right of the department to revise an assessment order that had been made under the provisions of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, but was intended only to devise a new method and mechanism to determine income and the tax payable for the post repeal era---Hence, the whole purpose of incorporating S. 239 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 was to preserve certain powers and procedures laid down in the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, so that it could be subsequently enforced in the post repeal era only in matters that related to the period covered under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979.     (c) Income Tax Ordinance (XLIX of 2001)---     ----Ss. 122(5A) & 239(1)---Income Tax Ordinance (XXXI of 1979), S.66A [since repealed]---General Clauses Act (X of 1897), S. 6---Original assessment order relating to period of repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 i.e. on or before 30-06-2002---Commissioner serving notice to tax-payer under S. 122(5A) of Income Tax Ordinance 2001, to amend such original assessment order---Legality---Sending of such notice under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 was technical mistake as the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 was the applicable law for revising/amending such assessment---Section 239 of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, had preserved the powers of the tax authorities to amend assessments orders pertaining to the period falling under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Notice for reopening/amending the assessment in the present case, thus, should have been issued under S. 66A of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979---Supreme Court treated notice under S. 122(5A) of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 to be notice issued under S. 66A of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 and directed Commissioner, Income Tax (Appeals) to decide the appeal afresh.     Honda Shahrah-e-Faisal Association of Persons, Karachi v. Regional Commissioner of Income Tax, Karachi 2005 PTD 1316 not approved.     Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, stood repealed with effect from 30-06-2002 and was replaced by the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, which came into operation immediately thereafter i.e. with effect from 01-07-2002. Section 239(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, provided that any assessment that was to be made for the income years ending on or before 30-06-2002, the same had to be made under the provisions of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, as if Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, had not come into force. The question that arose in the present case was whether the Commission Income Tax was justified in revising an assessment order relating to the period covered under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, by invoking the provisions of section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, that was inserted on 01.07.2003 i.e. one year after the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, came into operation.     Provisions of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, could not be interpreted in a manner so as to take away the powers of the Taxing Authority to revise, within the prescribed period of time, any assessment order that was passed under the provisions of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979.     Honda Shahrah-e-Faisal Association of Persons, Karachi v. Regional Commissioner of Income Tax, Karachi 2005 PTD 1316 not approved.     Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, had preserved the powers of the tax authorities to revise assessments orders pertaining to the period falling under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, i.e. on or before 30-06-2002, and for such purpose Section 239(1) was incorporated in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 as a saving clause. Additionally, assessments from period of repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 could also be revised/amended on the strength of the provisions of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 as the charge of tax stood created, in the present case on or before 30.06.2002 thus transforming the State's right to claim tax into a vested right. Had the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, not come into existence, the assessment in the present case could have been amended under the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, within five years of its finalisation i.e. within five years from 14-5-2003, when the initial assessment order in the present case was passed. This right to revise the assessment in question could be exercised under the provisions of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, uptill 13-05-2008 which right was never given up under any provision of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. In the present case, on the strength of section 239(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 the machinery provided under section 122(5A) of the same Ordinance, was brought into play to send a notice for the assessment year in question. This was only a technical mistake because in terms of section 239 (1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, notice for reopening the assessment in question should have been issued under section 66A of the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979. It thus did not follow that the notice was invalid under the law.     Supreme Court treated notice under section 122(5A) of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 to be notice issued under section 66A of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 and directed Commissioner, Income Tax (Appeals) to decide the appeal afresh.     (d) Interpretation of statutes---     ----Amendment---Provision incorporated in a statute through an amendment that was procedural in nature---Retrospective rule of construction was to be applied to such provision---Such a provision had to be construed as if it was incorporated on the date when the main enactment reached the statute book.     (e) Income Tax Ordinance (XLIX of 2001)---     ----S. 239(1) [as amended by the Finance Act, 2002]---Income Tax Ordinance (XXXI of 1979), Preamble [since repealed]---Retrospective effect of amended S. 239(1) of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001---Merely because the amended S. 239(1) was inserted in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, on 01-07-2003 instead of 1-7-2002 when the parent statute i.e. Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 came into operation, it could not be said that a vacuum was created in giving effect to it from the date when the main enactment came into operation---By virtue of the amended S. 239(1), the powers or inchoate rights relating to income years covered under repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, to the extent mentioned in S. 239 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, were to continue to be exercised/enforced on the basis of the procedures prescribed in the repealed law as if the repealed Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 was still in operation---Provisions of S. 239(1) of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 applied retrospectively.     Honda Shahrah-e-Faisal Association of Persons, Karachi v. Regional Commissioner of Income Tax, Karachi 2005 PTD 1316 not approved.     Commissioner of Income Tax v. Asbestos Cement Industries Ltd. 1993 SCMR 1276 and Fazal Dad v. Mst. Sakina Bibi and another 1997 MLD 2861 ref.     (f) Income Tax Ordinance (XLIX of 2001)---     ----Preamble---General Clauses Act (X of 1897), S. 6---Liability to pay income tax---Accrued on the tax payer on the last day of the income year/accounting year creating a vested right in favour of the State---Provisions in income tax law relating to its assessment were thus machinery provisions only for the purpose of quantifying the liability to pay income tax, which liability had become absolute on completion of the income year/accounting year.     Liability to pay income tax accrues on the taxpayer on the last day of the income year/accounting year, though the tax became payable after it was quantified in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Income Tax law. Thus a vested right in favour of the State was created at the end of each accounting year, though the exercise of (i) making an assessment on the basis of ascertainable data of income and expenditure, or (ii) revising an assessment order where it was found that there was sufficient material to hold that the original assessment was prejudicial to the interest of the revenue, took place at some later stage. These procedural exercises were undertaken only with the object of reaching at the correct calculation of yearly income but the real liability to pay tax had already accrued on the last day of the income year i.e. on the last day of the accounting year thereby creating a vested right in favour of the State. It may be understood as an expense that has already accrued but was payable later. Thus provisions in income tax law relating to its assessment were machinery provisions only for the purpose of quantifying the liability. Seeking revision of a tax return at any subsequent stage had nothing to do with the creation of charge on the tax-payer that had become absolute on completion of the income year/accounting year.

Azmat Saeed and Faisal Arab, JJ Ms. SHAMUNA BADSHAH QAISARANI---Appellant Versus Khuwaja MUHAMMAD DAWOOD and others---Respondents Civil Appeal No. 1628 of 2014, decided on 9th May, 2016. (On appeal against the judgment dated 19-11-2014 passed by Election Tribunal, Bahawalpur and D.G. Khan Divisions in Election Petition No. 13 of 2013) (a) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----S. 76A---Non-disclosure/incorrect disclosure of properties belonging to returned candidate and her spouse---Election of returned candidate declared as void---Fact that certain properties were not disclosed in the nomination papers was not denied by the returned candidate in the present case---Plea by returned candidate that subject properties were not disclosed as they were transferred to her brother, did not find support from the revenue record---Only in an affidavit it had been disclosed that the properties had been transferred to her brothers---At the time of filing of the nomination papers these properties were admittedly in the name of the returned candidate and her spouse in the revenue record---Election Tribunal, in such circumstances, had rightly declared election of returned candidate as void and ordered fresh elections in the constituency.     (b) Representation of the People Act (LXXXV of 1976)---     ----Ss. 52 & 76A---Constitution of Pakistan, Art. 225---Election petition filed before the Election Tribunal along with an application under S.76A of Representation of the People Act, 1976---Corrupt and illegal practices alleged in the election petition not proved---Application under S. 76A could still be entertained and decided upon even where the petitioner failed in establishing allegations of corrupt and illegal practices made in the election petition---Such procedure was very much within the confines of Art. 225 of the Constitution, thus it could not be said to be unconstitutional.     Election petition alleging corrupt and illegal practices committed by returned candidate was filed before the Election Tribunal. During pendency of election petition an application was filed under section 76A of Representation of the People Act, 1976 alleging that the returned candidate had also failed to disclose certain properties belonging to her and her spouse. Before the Tribunal though the allegations of corrupt practices could not be established however while hearing the application filed under section 76A of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 it transpired that the returned candidate did in fact fail to disclose certain properties in her nomination form belonging to her and her spouse. Election of the returned candidate was declared void and fresh elections were ordered to be held in the constituency. Returned candidate contended that section 76A of Representation of the People Act, 1976 was contrary to the provisions of Article 225 of the Constitution; that according to Article 225 of the Constitution, no election to a House or Provincial Assembly could be called in question except by election petition and in the present election petition the petitioner failed in establishing plea of corrupt and illegal election practices and that, in the circumstances, the Election Tribunal ought not to have entertained the application filed under section 76A of Representation of the People Act, 1976.     Article 225 of the Constitution clearly provided that no election to a House or Provincial Assembly shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such tribunal and in such manner as may be determined by an Act of Parliament. The Representation of the People Act, 1976 was an Act of the Parliament, which had provided the manner in which an election was to be challenged before the Election Tribunal. Section 76A of the Representation of the People Act, 1976 granted suo motu powers to the Election Tribunal to declare election of a returned candidate void on certain grounds which included non-disclosure or incorrect disclosure of assets of the candidate or his spouse or his dependents. Under section 76A such disclosure could come from any source before the Election Tribunal, which in the present case came from the election petitioner. Procedure adopted by the election petitioner and entertained by the Election Tribunal in the present case was very much within the confines of Article 225 of the Constitution, thus it could not be said to be unconstitutional.

that another applicant, who was 39 years of age at the time of applying for the post, was issued appointment letter without any exception, therefore, present case was one of discrimination---Contentions on behalf of Federal Government were that originally age for the advertised position was 25 years, which was increased to 30 years as per the notification in question; that mentioning of 35 years as the upper age limit for the advertised post was a typo-error, as such appellant could not be extended further age relaxation---Validity---Appellant had not procured her appointment letter through dubious means, and she could not be attributed any wrong on her part---Government department could not be allowed to take benefit of its own oversight, lapse or ignorance of law (i.e. Office Memorandum No.F.9/2/9 R5 dated 28th November, 2000 regarding relaxation of general age]---If the notification/memorandum in question had gone unnoticed by the Government department, it was not the fault of appellant---Liability for wrongly mentioning the qualifying age in the advertisement as 35 years could not be attributed to the appellant, and no corrigendum was published in the newspapers to such an effect---Appellant had joined the service after appearing in the test and qualifying in the interview---For a period of seven months (i.e. from the last date for applying for the advertised post till date of issuance of appointment letter to appellant), it did not occur to the Government department that appellant was over aged by two years (37 years) as against the age of 35 years as advertised---In terms of Chapter-II of National Command Authority Rules, para 7(K) for initial appointment the age prescribed was not less than 18 years or more than 35 years of age---However it was specifically stipulated in the said Rule that the said age limit may be relaxed in exceptional cases upto 45 years by the competent authority---Said Rule was not considered by the Government department in the present case---Government department did not dispute that the appellant did not possess the required qualification for the relevant post and/or that she did not serve the department satisfactorily---Appellant had applied for the advertised post giving her full particulars, including her qualification and age---At the time of joining she submitted the age relaxation certificate---Even if it is presumed that the competent authority over-sighted her age, it would be deemed to have been relaxed in exercise of power vested in the authority---Under the facts and circumstances of the present case, a right had come to vest in the appellant on issuance of appointment letter and more so after joining the service---Another applicant, who was 39 years of age at the time of applying for the post in question, was appointed to the post and no exception to her being over-age was taken by the Government department---Appellant, in such circumstances, was justified to urge that she had been discriminated against---General benefit of age relaxation extended to the employees of the Federal Government across the board, and extended to all departments under the Federal government pursuant to any policy decision could not be denied on the assumption, that particular department was not bound by such decision as it had its own rules---Nothing was brought on record to show that such directive/policy decision expressed through memorandum/notification was not applicable to the Government department in question---Supreme Court directed that appellant shall be given joining within one month from date of present judgment; that her seniority would be counted from the date of her appointment letter, and that no back benefit will be extended to her for the period she remained out of office one month from the date of present order---Appeal was allowed accordingly.
